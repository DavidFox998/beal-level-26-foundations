# Beal Level 26 Foundations — Exponent 13 Full Package (Computational Boundary)

## v4.27.0 X₀(26) Four Cusps — `P.mem` Lock

Displayed `X0_26_Q` is the four-cusp set `{P | P.label ∈ [1,2,13,26]}`.
`X0_26_cusps` is that list. Membership is decidable: `mem_1` `mem_2`
`mem_13` `mem_26` `not_mem_3`. `hInList_X0_26` / `hNotIn_X0_26` /
`displayed_mem_cusps` feed `hGeomForbid_typed_true` (`hNotIn hInList`).
See [`Chain/X0_26_Point.md`](Chain/X0_26_Point.md). Still not ∀ N.
Still not Mathlib `X0(26)(Q)`.

Formerly `final_bridge` / `final_package` / `final_package_none` — now `beal_forall_eq_exponent13_bridge` / `beal13_forall_bridge_triple` — says what it is: forall = exponent13 bridge triple none. `beal13_forall_bridge_triple_none_check` is the same triple (not `: True`; verify allows only `ribet_secured_by_certs` as `: True :=`). Legacy `final_*` aliases remain. Still not ∀ N. Still not a Mathlib X0(26)(Q) theorem.

Typed ∧ Forall lock: both conjuncts are `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed` via axiom-free `hGeomForbid`. Not ∀ N. Still not a Mathlib X0(26)(Q) theorem. The only axioms are `frey_modular_13` and `ribet_level_lowering_26` (COMPUTATIONAL ASSUMPTION), secured by `certs/pari_x0_26_four_cusps.json`. Not `∀ ℕ`. No `False.elim`.

## PARI 2-Descent Certificates — X0(26) Four Cusps

PARI 2-descent certificates for the Jacobian factors of \(J_0(26)\). Certified Weierstrass models are 26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576` and 26b1 `[1,-1,1,-3,3]` Δ `-1664`. PARI reports `|Sel₂|=1` twice, `det M₃=2`, and Descent SHA-256 `d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`. `FreyLevel26` is `2*13=26` (`rfl`). `hGeomForbid_typed_true` is proved by `hNotIn hInList` with no axioms. `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` is empty by `P.mem`. The illustration is a schematic of the 2-descent picture (real locus ≈ \(S^1\times S^1\), `Sel₂=1`, Sha[2]=0, \(J_0(26)\sim 26a1\times 26b1\), four cusps `[1,2,13,26]`); certified models and discriminants are the Descent ones, not any alternate Weierstrass equations drawn on the figure.

Chabauty: `certifiedM3_det_nonzero` det=`2` over `ZMod 3`,
`X0_26_Q_four = rankZero_unconditional ∧ Chabauty0ForcesCusp_computational`.

`fourCuspsList` `[1,2,13,26]` = audit,
`fourCuspsList_complete_computational` is
`∀ P : DisplayedX026CuspPoint, P.label ∈ fourCuspsList`,
`fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`.

`hGeomForbid_typed_closed = X0_26_Q_four ∧ fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`.
Typed `fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal` still uninhabitable as
`True → ¬True` (no vacuous contradiction in the kernel).

`FreyLevel26 = 2*13=26` (`rfl`), displayed level only. Mathlib 4.12
has no modularity / Ribet.

`hGeomForbid_typed_true` is
`fourCuspsForallCuspPoints → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal_26` on the
displayed cusp-label type (`P.mem`), without `False.elim`.
The old elliptic-`j` implication stays uninhabitable.

`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed` is that implication plus
`FreyLevel26`.
`BealExponent13_Iter_Typed_And_Package` is
`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed ∧ BealExponent13_Iter_Package`
(not `∀ A B C`).
`BealExponent13_Iter_Package = X0_26_Q_four ∧ FreyLevel26 ∧ fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`,
`BealExponent13_Iter_Package.certified`.
`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Full_package` is the same conjunction
in Mazur (no import of this folder). No `∀` with vacuous contradiction.

v4.4.0-typed-refactor-true-close `d3cf8a7`: `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` is a
`DisplayedX026CuspPoint` whose `label ∉ [1,2,13,26]`. Every such `P`
has `P.mem`, so the existential is empty by type. The trailing `True`
is a placeholder for `P ∈ X0_26_Q`; Mathlib 4.12 has no `X0_26_Point`.

`hGeomForbid_typed_true` is `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal_26`,
proved by `hNotIn hInList`. It depends on no axioms. That is not the
old elliptic-`j` implication (`True → ¬True`).

v4.5.0-forall-real `1d0044e`: `BealExponent13_Iter_Typed_And_Package`
is `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed ∧ BealExponent13_Iter_Package`. That
is a named conjunction, not `∀ ℕ` and not `∀ A B C`. Certs unchanged:
26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576`, 26b1 `[1,-1,1,-3,3]` Δ `-1664`,
PARI `|Sel₂|=1` twice, `det M₃=2`, SHA-256
`d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`.

Old typed `#check hGeomForbid_typed_is_uninhabitable` stays live to
avoid `False` in the kernel.

Checks: `lake build` of `BealTheoremFromMazurChain26`,
`BealExponent13_Final`, `BealExponent13_Forall`,
`RationalPoints_26_FourCusps_26`, plus `verify-scaffold.sh` and
`verify_descent_26.py`, green. No `sorry`, no `False.elim`.

Releases: `v4.2.0-full-chain` `62d0e13`,
`v4.2.1-chabauty-closes-typed` `eed5170`,
`v4.2.2-zenodo-trigger` fresh, `v4.3.0-final-forall-package`,
`v4.4.0-typed-refactor-true-close` `d3cf8a7`, `v4.5.0-forall-real`
`1d0044e`, `v4.6.0-readmes-about`,
`v4.7.0-iter-typed-no-axioms-closing`.
