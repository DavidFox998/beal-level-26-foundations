# v8.0.0 BealForallProof FullProof glue

`lean/BealLevel26Foundations/Beal/FullProof/BealForallProof.lean`

Step 4 toward Beal `∀`.  The none-chain sketch
`Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch`
stays **uninhabited**.  No `sorry`.  No `False.elim`.
This file does **not** import `BealForall.lean`.

| Name | Status |
|---|---|
| `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` | copied type; **not** inhabited |
| `sketch_fails_on_zero_one` | `¬` the unguarded type: `0³ + 1³ = 1³`, `gcd(0,1,1) = 1` |
| `ModularImpliesLevel2Newform` | missing Mathlib arrow `Modular w → ExistsNewformLevel2` |
| `beal_forall_glue` | inhabited Tate + Ribet/`R = T` + GeometryBridge pack |
| `beal_forall_proof` | positive-bases Beal **from** that arrow |
| `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch_stays_uninhabited` | lock: the unguarded sketch is not this file's theorem |

`#print axioms` on `beal_forall_glue` and
`beal_forall_proof` is
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
`sketch_fails_on_zero_one` is `[propext]`.  No `sorryAx`.

Why the unguarded sketch cannot be inhabited:

1. It omits `0 < A,B,C`.  `0³ + 1³ = 1³` is a
   counterexample.  Beal requires positive bases.
2. Mathlib 4.12 has no Wiles modularity or Ribet functor
   that produces `ExistsNewformLevel2` (`0 ≠ 0`).
   `wiles_modularity_Frey` is the Wiles-domain input.

This is **not** an unconditional Beal theorem and is
**not** a journal-submission proof of Beal.
