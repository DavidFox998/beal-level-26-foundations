This directory contains the typed Galois-representation, mod-ℓ form, level-lowering, and Hecke-theoretic interfaces used by the Beal formalization.

It is intentionally a **boundary layer**, not an unconditional proof of Beal's Conjecture. The files provide data structures, propositions, coefficient operations, and small transport lemmas. They do not silently turn the classical theorems of Wiles, Tate, or Ribet into Lean theorems.

## v8.9.0 release context

The v8.9.0 Real 80-Check Audit is a Level-26 Phase A computation outside this
directory. It leaves the Galois/Hecke boundary unchanged: the 80-entry
bad-prime audit does not construct modular forms, prove level lowering, or
discharge any of the Wiles, Tate, Ribet, support, or transport interfaces
described here. The Phase B+C+D Beal chain remains conditional.

## Historical v7.3.0 typed Eutheos edge status

The historical v7.3.0 branch `beal-4.12-ihra-eutheos` extended the v7.2
V-specific eigenline edge. The boundary is explicit and data-valued:

- The old B15 declaration `ribet_single_step : Prop` has been deleted from
  the active source path.
- `SupportedNewformToTokenProvider` is an explicit missing function returning
  `PreservedForm` data from a residual representation, maximal ideal, genuine
  coefficient submodule, and `SupportInNewSubspace`. It is inspectable and
  introduces no choice; because the residual representation carries a
  universe-polymorphic group carrier, Lean reports its type as `Type 1`.
- `NewformHeckeToPreservedTokenTransport` isolates the narrower mathematical
  conversion: a finite newform, its realization of the fixed residual
  representation, and annihilation by the attached maximal ideal must produce
  the B15 token. `NewSubspaceSupportData` retains those witnesses in `Type`,
  and `preservedToken_of_supportData` performs the exact transport without
  `Classical.choice`. The existing proposition-valued support existential
  cannot be eliminated into `PreservedForm` constructively; no inhabitant of
  the data or transport boundary is claimed.
- `GaloisEdgeWitness` carries the residual representation, maximal ideal,
  genuine coefficient submodule, localized Hecke data, attachment,
  `NormalizedEigenlineData`, typed Eutheos geometry, Taylor–Wiles patching
  data, 07j support assembly, `NewSubspaceSupportData`, and
  `NewformHeckeToPreservedTokenTransport` for one exact lowering edge.
- B15 derives `QExpansionPrincipleOnV` through
  `QExpansionPrincipleOnV_fromEigenline`; `hQ` is not a field of the edge.
- `GaloisDescentPlan` is indexed by the exact Wiles arithmetic-plan value and
  its model-dependent Tate certificate, so every enriched edge has that
  constructor's `N`, `p`, and `M`; the supplier cannot substitute another
  chain or conductor provenance.
- `EnrichedPlanSupplier` converts the Tate-certified Wiles quotient plan into
  this per-edge plan. The recursive B15 proof no longer consumes a universal
  `RibetSingleStepProviders` family.
- `#print axioms ribet_single_step_from_genuine` reports
  `[propext, Quot.sound]`.
- The remaining named mathematical inputs on the final path are
  `wiles_modularity`, `frey_conductor_data`,
  and `tate_step2_odd_prime_external`. The separate 2-adic exponent-one and
  enriched-plan suppliers are conditional data boundaries, not theorems
  silently derived from the Galois files.
- B15 invokes the proved `tate_frey_multiplicative_at_model` specialization to
  certify every exact-divisibility edge. Neither the Wiles plan nor
  `GaloisEdgeWitness` carries a duplicate `ExactDividesCore` field.
- `TateStep2.freyModelOf` constructs the coefficient model without
  `Classical.choice`; the conductor comes from the typed global boundary. It
  is not introduced by 07k or by the B15 genuine-provider bridge.
- 07f proves that genuine form data excludes the raw 07c counterexample
  `(-Bp, 1, 1)`.
- 07g proves `ihara_zero_on_genuine_V_conditional`: the restricted Ihara
  conclusion follows without choice from the explicit
  `QExpansionPrincipleOnV` premise. Constructing that geometric premise for
  the actual modular-form submodule remains **MISSING**; 07f's single raw
  witness exclusion is not presented as a proof of all oldform relations.
- 07l provides a structured Shimura/q-expansion supplier boundary. It proves
  the exact 07g coefficient-cancellation premise from explicit geometric
  source and target form carriers, q-expansion compatibility and injectivity,
  and a genuine two-degeneracy-map kernel theorem. It does not claim those
  geometric fields are already constructed.
- 07h now owns the unchanged `OldNewDecompHyp` proposition and proves
  `old_new_decomp_from_ihara` from restricted Ihara kernel-zero plus the
  explicit `AtkinLehnerProjectorOnV` complement premise.
  `old_new_decomp_from_genuine` obtains the Ihara input from 07g's
  `QExpansionPrincipleOnV` theorem and performs the same transport without
  choice. Constructing the actual old subspace, projector, and new complement
  remains **MISSING**; Ihara kernel-zero alone is not presented as an
  Atkin–Lehner decomposition theorem.
- `07h_EutheosGeometry` supplies the choice-free typed layer below that
  proposition. It records the two coefficient-level degeneracy maps, their
  exact old-image description, named Hecke-stable old and new modules,
  genuine-form generation fields, coverage of `V`, and a geometric
  old/new-intersection kernel parameterized by `EutheosJitter`.
  `OldNewDecompHyp_from_Eutheos` constructs the existing proposition from
  those lower-level fields. The kernel field is the explicit place where a
  future modular-curve proof must connect the jitter inequality to geometry;
  the arithmetic certificate alone is not presented as proving that theorem.
- `07h_DesertInfra` connects 07h to the vendored Lean 4.12
  desert-brothers interface. `EutheosJitter` stores the denominator-cleared
  fixed-point inequality as natural-number data, avoiding the upstream 4.15
  import and large `native_decide` proof. A separate real bridge proves the
  intended reciprocal nearest-integer inequality and isolates the real
  field's `Classical.choice` footprint. The historical
  `EutheosComplementSketch` still carries `OldNewDecompHyp` explicitly for
  audit compatibility, but B15 now consumes `EutheosGeometryInterface` and
  derives its old/new witness at the use site.
- B14's Wiles boundary still returns the arithmetic plan only. The B15
  supplier adds normalized eigenline data, typed Eutheos geometry, explicit
  patching/specialization data, support assembly, and token-transport data on
  every edge without a B14 → Galois import cycle.

The primary dependency path is:

```text
01_Absolute
      ↓
02_ResidualRep
      ↓
03_ModLForm
      ├──────────────→ 04_LevelLowering

                                              08_RibetProof
```

`05_Hecke` imports `03_ModLForm` directly. It therefore receives the earlier Galois and representation definitions transitively, but does not import `04_LevelLowering`. This keeps the coefficient-level Hecke construction independent of the still-open level-lowering transport proposition. `06_MaximalIdeal` is the first layer to place the two boundaries alongside one another; `07_NewformSupport` states the missing support implication; and `08_RibetProof` proves only the final extraction of a lower-level witness from explicitly supplied support.

## Design principles

### Typed boundaries

The Frey curve is represented by the existing typed `FreyCurveModel` from `Beal.B14_FreyTate`. The residual representation, the mod-ℓ form, and the conductor divisibility witness are tied to that model through their types and fields. This prevents a form or representation from silently being associated with a different curve or conductor.

### Explicit hypotheses

The statements in this directory do not infer residual unramifiedness merely from conductor-exponent information. In particular, the fact that an odd prime `p` divides a level exactly once does not, by itself, prove that inertia acts trivially on the residual representation. The level-lowering boundary therefore takes unramifiedness as an explicit hypothesis.

The odd-prime boundary is retained, including `p = 3`: the code records `p.Prime`, `p ≠ 2`, and the exact-divisibility condition separately.

### Finite and algebraic models

The mod-ℓ form record stores a finite list of coefficients. It is not Mathlib's complex-analytic `CuspForm` and does not claim to be an analytic modular form. The Hecke algebra consequently acts on all coefficient sequences `ℕ → ZMod ℓ`, where the required additive and scalar-module structure is available.

### Foundational audit

The modules avoid executable `sorry` placeholders and do not declare mathematical `axiom`s. The principal declarations have been audited for their Lean foundation dependencies; the expected footprint is the foundational pair

```text
[propext, Quot.sound]
```

These are Lean/library dependencies, not additional mathematical assumptions such as modularity, Tate's theorem, or Ribet's theorem.

## File-by-file guide

### `01_Absolute.lean`

**Imports**

- `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.Defs`

**Purpose**

This is the abstract local Galois interface. It does not construct `ℚ̄`, identify a concrete absolute Galois group, or add a topology or field extension. It supplies only the group and subgroup data needed to state inertia and unramifiedness.

**Main declarations**

- `AbsoluteGaloisGroup` — an abstract carrier equipped with a group structure.
- `GaloisSubgroup` — a constructive subgroup interface with membership of `1`, closure under multiplication, and closure under inverses.
- `DecompositionSubgroup` — a decomposition subgroup at a natural-number prime index.
- `InertiaSubgroup` — an inertia subgroup together with its inclusion into the decomposition subgroup.
- `DecompositionElement` — the subtype of elements belonging to a decomposition subgroup.
- `InertiaSubgroup.toDecomposition` and `InertiaSubgroup.toAbsolute` — the two canonical inclusions.
- `inertiaCosetSetoid` — the right-coset relation modulo inertia.
- `FrobeniusClass` and `FrobeniusClass.mk` — the quotient class of a decomposition element modulo inertia.
- `GL2` — the two-dimensional linear automorphism group over `ZMod ℓ`.
- `ResidualRepresentation` — a function from the abstract absolute-Galois carrier to `GL2`.
- `IsUnramifiedAt` — the proposition that every inertia element acts trivially.

**Proved result**

- `isUnramifiedAt_iff` — unfolds `IsUnramifiedAt` to the explicit statement that `ρ g = 1` for every element `g` of inertia. It is an interface equivalence, not a theorem establishing unramifiedness for a particular representation.

### `02_ResidualRep.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.01_Absolute`
- `Beal.B14_FreyTate`

**Purpose**

This file packages the representation data associated with one fixed Frey curve model. The absolute-Galois group and representation remain supplied data; this layer does not construct the elliptic-curve torsion representation.

**Main declarations**

- `FreyResidualRepresentation` — stores:
  - an abstract absolute-Galois group `Gabs`,
  - a representation `rho : Gabs.carrier → GL2 ℓ`,
  - proposition-valued fields for `continuous`, `semisimple`, and `odd`.
- `IsFreyUnramifiedAt` — specializes `IsUnramifiedAt` to the `Gabs` and `rho` stored in a `FreyResidualRepresentation`.

**What is deliberately not proved**

This module does not prove continuity, semisimplicity, oddness, irreducibility, or any implication from Tate's conductor calculation to trivial inertia. Those properties remain explicit inputs for later mathematics.

### `03_ModLForm.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.01_Absolute`
- `Beal.Galois.02_ResidualRep`
- `Beal.B14_FreyTate`

**Purpose**

This file defines the finite mod-ℓ q-expansion boundary and its proposed trace compatibility with a Frey residual representation.

**Main declarations**

- `ModLWeightTwoForm` — a finite coefficient list `f_q : List (ZMod ℓ)`, together with:
  - a witness that the level `N` divides the conductor of the same Frey model,
  - a proposition-valued `nonzero` field.
- `standardBasis` — the two standard basis vectors of `Fin 2 → ZMod ℓ`.
- `modLTrace` — the trace expression for a `GL2 ℓ` automorphism, evaluated on those basis vectors.
- `ModLRealizesRepresentation` — the explicit finite, representative-aware trace compatibility condition:
  coefficients at indices coprime to `N * ℓ` must match the trace of the supplied residual representation on a representative of the corresponding Frobenius class.

The realization condition quantifies over the inertia subgroup, Frobenius quotient class, and decomposition representative. Requiring the equality `FrobeniusClass.mk I g = F` avoids choosing a representative from a quotient by `Classical.choice`.

**What is deliberately not proved**

The finite list is not a construction of a modular form, the trace condition is not a modularity theorem, and no form is transported to a lower level here. Complex-analytic cusp-form infrastructure is outside this boundary.

### `04_LevelLowering.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.01_Absolute`
- `Beal.Galois.02_ResidualRep`
- `Beal.Galois.03_ModLForm`
- `Beal.B14_FreyTate`
- `Beal.B03_Conductor_Core`

**Purpose**

This file states the exact proposition needed for one honest Ribet level-lowering step. It defines the target statement rather than declaring it as an admitted theorem.

**Main declaration**

- `frey_level_lowering_of_unramified` — a proposition whose inputs include:
  - the typed Frey model,
  - residual prime `ℓ`,
  - original level `N` and target level `M`,
  - `M * p = N`,
  - exact divisibility of `N` by `p`,
  - primality of `p`,
  - oddness `p ≠ 2`,
  - a Frey residual representation,
  - an inertia subgroup at `p`,
  - explicit residual unramifiedness,
  - a mod-ℓ form `W` at level `N`,
  - and the realization condition for `W`.

Its conclusion is that there exists a form `W'` at level `M` realizing the same residual representation.

The declaration is a `def` of a proposition, not a proof of that proposition. A future proof must supply the missing Hecke-algebra, newform, and transport arguments. In particular, defining this proposition does not construct the explicit enriched plan consumed by the final Beal proof.

### `05_Hecke.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.03_ModLForm`

**Purpose**

This file supplies coefficient-level Hecke operations and an algebraic old/new boundary. It gives the finite q-expansion and coefficient-sequence operations needed for later work, but does not prove that a modular form exists, that a form is a Hecke eigenform, or that level lowering follows.

**Finite coefficient operations**

- `finiteCoeff` — reads a coefficient from a finite list and returns `0` beyond the list.
- `heckeCoeff` — implements

  ```text
  (T_p a)_0 = 0
  (T_p a)_n = a_(p*n) + (if p ∣ n then p * a_(n/p) else 0),  n > 0
  ```

- `heckeCoeff_zero` — proves that the constant coefficient is zero.
- `heckeList` — applies the operation across the finite list while retaining the list's support length.
- `HeckeOp` — applies the coefficient operation to a `ModLWeightTwoForm` at the same level.
- `HeckeOp_level_divides_conductor` — proves that the level-divisibility witness is preserved by `HeckeOp`.

The ambient coefficient formula accepts any natural-number index `p`. The restriction to prime indices away from the level is imposed when generators of the Hecke algebra are formed.

**Degeneracy and old/new boundary**

- `DegeneracyMap` — the finite coefficient-level degeneracy formula from level `M` to level `N`. It requires positive degeneracy factor, the divisibility relation for the factor, and an explicit target witness `N ∣ model.conductor`.
- `OldSubspace` — the set of level-`N` forms obtained from lower levels by an allowed degeneracy map.
- `IsNewform` — the proposition that a form lies in none of the represented lower-level degeneracy images.

The explicit target conductor witness is intentional: `M ∣ N` and `M ∣ conductor` do not imply `N ∣ conductor`.

**Sequence-level Hecke algebra**

- `CoefficientSequence` — the honest ambient module `ℕ → ZMod ℓ`.
- `heckeSequenceCoeff` — the same Hecke coefficient formula on an infinite coefficient sequence.
- `heckeSequenceCoeff_add` — proves additivity pointwise.
- `heckeSequenceCoeff_smul` — proves `ZMod ℓ`-linearity pointwise.
- `HeckeSequenceOp` — packages the operation as a `Module.End`.
- `HeckeGenerators` — the set of `T_p` operators for prime `p` with `p ∤ N`.
- `HeckeExpression` — finite formal expressions built from zero, one, allowed generators, addition, negation, and multiplication.
- `HeckeExpression.eval` — evaluates those expressions as sequence endomorphisms.
- `HeckeAlgebra` — the constructively generated subring given by the range of `HeckeExpression.eval`.
- `heckeSequenceOp_mem_HeckeAlgebra` — proves that every allowed generator belongs to this algebra.

The explicit expression syntax is used instead of `Subring.closure`. In this abstract setting, the closure implementation would introduce `Classical.choice` into the axiom audit. The resulting `HeckeAlgebra` is a genuine generated subring of coefficient-sequence endomorphisms, but it does not yet encode a maximal ideal, eigenform decomposition, or a representation theorem.

### `06_MaximalIdeal.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.04_LevelLowering`
- `Beal.Galois.05_Hecke`

**Purpose**

This file records the Hecke-theoretic data that a genuine replacement for the typed Ribet boundary would need. It does not construct a maximal ideal or prove the Hecke-algebra representation theorem. Instead, it makes the desired attachment to the Frey residual representation and the target support statement explicit.

**Main declarations**

- `HeckeIdealLike` — a two-sided, additive ideal-like subset of `HeckeAlgebra N ℓ`. The interface is explicit because the ambient endomorphism ring need not be commutative.
- `HeckeIdealLike.IsMaximal` — the predicate that every larger ideal-like object is either equal to the candidate or the whole Hecke algebra.
- `IsMaximalIdeal` and `MaximalIdeal` — the typed maximality predicate and its candidate-ideal package. They intentionally use the two-sided interface rather than Mathlib's commutative `Ideal`.
- `ResidueFieldData` and `ResidueFieldIsZMod` — an explicit, supplied identification of the future residue-field carrier with `ZMod ℓ`; no quotient or field construction is claimed.
- `FreyHeckeAttachment` — the required residual attachment data: maximality, residue-field identification, a quotient-style evaluation to `ZMod ℓ`, its kernel, away-from-level Hecke-generator traces, and compatibility with explicit Frobenius representatives.
- `MaximalIdealAttachedToRep` — the interface-only assertion that a candidate maximal ideal is attached to `R` and satisfies `T_p mod 𝔪 = trace(R(Frob_p))` for primes away from `N * ℓ`.
- `coefficientSequenceOfForm` — extends the finite q-expansion boundary by zero to the sequence module on which the Hecke algebra acts.
- `HeckeIdealAnnihilatesForm` — the finite coefficient-level convention that a candidate ideal annihilates a form's extended coefficient sequence.
- `IsSupportedInNewSubspace` — existence of a new finite mod-ℓ form which realizes the same Frey residual representation and is annihilated by the candidate ideal.
- `frey_unramified_implies_maximalIdeal_support` — the exact, still-unproved proposition required for one level-lowering step: under the existing exact-divisibility and odd-prime hypotheses, residual unramifiedness would give new-subspace support for an attached candidate maximal ideal at the lower level.

**What is deliberately not proved**

The module does not produce an ideal, show it is maximal, define a genuine Hecke eigenvalue system, prove a newform decomposition, or derive the displayed support implication. In particular, it does not treat Tate's conductor conclusion as a proof of residual unramifiedness. The final implication remains a `Prop` describing the missing Hecke-algebra representation theorem.

### `07_NewformSupport.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.06_MaximalIdeal`

**Purpose**

This file names the support conclusion at the divided level and states the
unramifiedness-to-support obligation for one exact odd-prime level division.

**Main declarations**

- `SupportInNewSubspace` — a maximal ideal occurs in the finite new boundary
  when its underlying ideal annihilates a new form that realizes the same
  residual representation.
- `frey_unramified_implies_newform_support` — the still-open proposition that
  exact division, explicit residual unramifiedness, and an attached maximal
  ideal provide that support.

Neither declaration proves support, constructs a newform, or turns Tate's
conductor exponent into an unramifiedness theorem.

### `07l_ShimuraQExpansionSupplier.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.07g_IharaOnV`

**Purpose**

This file is the organized landing zone for the first Shimura-side premise.
It does not copy the public Batch148 placeholder propositions into Beal and it
does not add the Arakelov repository as a Lake dependency. Instead it records
the exact geometric objects and compatibilities that a genuine supplier must
construct before 07g can use the result.

`ShimuraQExpansionData M p ℓ V` carries:

- a source-level geometric form type and a target geometric form type;
- zero forms and source/target q-expansion maps;
- an explicit realization of every coefficient sequence in `V` as a source
  form, with coefficient compatibility;
- a geometric map representing the sum of the two degeneracy images;
- the expected coefficient formula
  `q(β₁(a) + βₚ(b)) = q(a) + Bp(q(b))`;
- injectivity of the target q-expansion map; and
- the genuine geometric assertion that the degeneracy-pair map has trivial
  kernel.

From this data, `QExpansionPrincipleOnV_FromShimura` proves the exact
coefficient-cancellation proposition that the earlier explicit `hQ` edge
field represented. The active v7.2 edge instead derives this proposition from
normalized eigenline data.
`IharaKernelZeroOnV_FromShimura` then composes that adapter with the existing
07g theorem.

The dependency path is:

```text
geometric level-M source forms
      │  realization and q-expansion compatibility
      ▼
coefficient submodule V
      │
      ├── target q-expansion injectivity
      └── geometric kernel-zero for (β₁, βₚ)
                    │
                    ▼
       QExpansionPrincipleOnV
                    │
                    ▼
          IharaKernelZeroOnV
```

**How Batch148 is used**

The public 11,774-byte Batch148 file remains useful as a decomposition
roadmap, but not as a proof supplier:

| Batch148 component | Proper role in this route |
|---|---|
| Hecke eigenvalue system | Identifies the relevant eigenpacket; it does not prove degeneracy injectivity. |
| Jacobian simple factor | Motivates the geometric source/target realization that a future supplier must construct. |
| Frobenius/Hecke compatibility | Controls arithmetic traces; it does not imply `QExpansionPrincipleOnV`. |
| Weight-two normalization | Belongs to the trace/Satake route, not the 07g kernel argument. |

The direct Shimura route is therefore the correct path for `hQ`: formalize
the modular-curve form spaces, the two degeneracy maps, the target
q-expansion principle, and their geometric kernel theorem. Batch148 remains a
source ledger for nearby Hecke/Jacobian work and can later feed those concrete
constructions without being mistaken for the missing Ihara proof.

### `07m_FourierQExpansion.lean`

**Imports**

- `Mathlib.Analysis.Fourier.AddCircle`

**Purpose**

This file proves one honest analytic uniqueness fact:
`continuousFourierQExpansion` sends a genuine continuous complex function
`C(AddCircle T, ℂ)` to its complete `ℤ`-indexed Fourier coefficient sequence,
and `continuousFourierQExpansion_injective` proves that this map is injective
when `0 < T`.

The proof uses Mathlib's `fourierCoeff`, `fourierBasis`, and the faithful
continuous-function-to-`L²` map for normalized Haar measure. It is only a
q-expansion-style analytic foundation. In particular, it does **not** define
mod-`ℓ` modular forms, construct a modular-curve q-expansion map, provide a
`ShimuraQExpansionData` instance, or discharge the `QExpansionPrincipleOnV`
needed by 07g.

### `07n_NormalizedEigenlineQExpansion.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.07g_IharaOnV`

**Purpose**

This file supplies `QExpansionPrincipleOnV` for the narrower situation
actually used at a descent edge: `V` is an explicitly supplied
one-dimensional eigenline whose generator has first coefficient `1`.

`NormalizedEigenlineData` records the generator, its membership in `V`, the
fact that it spans `V`, and its normalization at `q`. The proof then reads a
relation

```text
a(q) + b(q^p) = 0
```

at `q^1` to prove `a = 0`, and at `q^(p*n)` to prove every coefficient of
`b` is zero. This yields
`QExpansionPrincipleOnV_fromEigenline` and the corresponding
restricted Ihara theorem without a new axiom or a full modular-form Fourier
library.

The analytic uniqueness theorem in 07m remains a separate background
foundation. The normalized-eigenline proof does not import it because the
V-specific argument needs only the `q^1` and `q^(p*n)` coefficients; adding an
unused analytic dependency would introduce `Classical.choice` without
strengthening this theorem.

The authentic 11,774-byte Batch148 v1 file is used only as provenance for the
intended normalized eigenform. Its executable `True` placeholders are not

q-expansion or degeneracy-kernel theorem.

### `08_RibetProof.lean`

**Imports**

- `Beal.Galois.07_NewformSupport`

**Purpose**

This file proves the formal final transport: an explicitly supplied
`SupportInNewSubspace` witness contains a level-`M` form realizing the residual
representation, so it proves the conclusion of
`frey_level_lowering_of_unramified`.

**Proved result**

- `frey_level_lowering_of_unramified_of_newform_support` — a conditional
  theorem from typed new-subspace support to the existing level-lowering
  proposition.

**What remains open**

The support premise still requires `QExpansionPrincipleOnV` for the relevant
mod-ℓ Hecke module, `AtkinLehnerProjectorOnV` for the actual old/new
complement, and multiplicity one for the localized Hecke algebra. Those are
documented as explicit missing mathematics, not represented by `sorry`, a
global axiom, or a claim of an unconditional Ribet theorem.

## What this directory establishes

Collectively, the files establish:

1. a typed abstract setting for absolute Galois, decomposition, and inertia data;
2. a representation record attached to the fixed Frey model;
3. a finite mod-ℓ form record and explicit Frobenius-trace compatibility proposition;
4. the precise hypotheses and conclusion required for a level-lowering transport step;
5. finite and sequence-level Hecke operations;
6. a constructive old/new boundary and generated coefficient Hecke algebra;
7. a typed residual-maximal-ideal and new-support interface spelling out the
   remaining Hecke-theoretic level-lowering obligation.
8. a proved conditional extraction from explicit new-subspace support to the
   existing one-step level-lowering proposition.
9. a proved conditional 07h transport from restricted Ihara kernel-zero and
   an explicit old/new complement premise to the V-specific decomposition
   hypothesis.
10. a data-valued representation/Hecke/newform transport boundary and a
    choice-free token construction from explicit support data.

## What this directory does not establish

No file here proves:

- existence of the absolute Galois group or a concrete `ℚ̄`;
- construction or continuity of the Frey residual representation;
- irreducibility, semisimplicity, or oddness of that representation;
- modularity of the Frey curve;
- Tate's local conductor-to-inertia implication;
- Ribet's level-lowering theorem;
- a newform decomposition;
- construction or maximality proof for an ideal `𝔪_ρ̄`;
- the Hecke-algebra representation theorem needed to attach `𝔪_ρ̄` and
  transport its support;
- the newform decomposition, mod-ℓ Ihara/Jacquet--Langlands input, or
  multiplicity-one theorem needed to prove that support;
- Fermat's Last Theorem or Beal's Conjecture.

Those boundaries remain explicit so that the final formal result can name its genuine mathematical assumptions rather than hide them inside a scaffold.

## Building the modules

From the repository root, build the latest Galois boundary layer with:

```sh
lake --old build 'Beal.Galois.«08_RibetProof»'
```

To build the coefficient-level Hecke layer alone, use
`Beal.Galois.«05_Hecke»`. The earlier layers can be built individually by
replacing the module name with:

```text
Beal.Galois.«01_Absolute»
Beal.Galois.«02_ResidualRep»
Beal.Galois.«03_ModLForm»
Beal.Galois.«04_LevelLowering»
Beal.Galois.«05_Hecke»
Beal.Galois.«06_MaximalIdeal»
Beal.Galois.«07_NewformSupport»
Beal.Galois.«07l_ShimuraQExpansionSupplier»
Beal.Galois.«07m_FourierQExpansion»
Beal.Galois.«08_RibetProof»
```

The source uses Lean 4.12. The numbered modules are deliberately small enough that their declarations and axiom reports can be audited directly.

## v7.3.1 audit clarification

The phrase **“0 axiom” is scoped to the typed Eutheos focused boundary**. It
means that `Beal.Galois.OldNewDecompHyp_from_Eutheos`, `EutheosJitter`, and
the jitter-indexed separation kernel introduce no proposition-valued axiom or
opaque declaration of their own and audit to `[propext, Quot.sound]`. The
V-specific edge is clean. The Task #440 build covered 2,424 targets and CI
#239 completed successfully in 53m23s.

This is not a repository-wide claim. B05 retains the named
`mazur_irreducibility_axiom` for its legacy natural-number compatibility
predicate and takes Wiles lifting as an explicit external hypothesis. The
patching layer's theorem-level, semiring-carrier R=T result instead requires
explicit inverse-map data and the Shimura q-expansion supplier; it does not
assert complete-local or commutative ring structure. None of these boundaries
is part of the typed Eutheos bridge.

The real-number interpretation of the fixed-point inequality
`‖p·α₀‖ < 1/p` remains isolated in the desert-brothers module and audits to
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. That choice-bearing real bridge
does not leak into the typed Eutheos/Beal path.

## v8.0.0 handoff to patching

The Galois layer still defines `LocalizedRankOne` as the target interface, but
B15 no longer accepts that proposition as edge data. The neighboring
`Beal/Patching/` modules expose finite patched levels, transition and diamond
maps, compatible projections, depth data, and rank-one coordinates; only then
does `LocalizedRankOne_from_Patching` construct the target.

The patching certificate is a visible Type-valued mathematical boundary. It is
not a renamed `LocalizedRankOne` field and it contains no stored linear
equivalence. Its level-zero reconstruction law is now proved from coherent
finite projections. The certificate is indexed by the same Frey residual
representation and `FreyHeckeAttachment` carried by the B15 edge. Its
localized residual map extends that attachment's evaluation, and its
finite-level diamond actions come from explicit deformation lifts. It does
not identify those lifts with Frobenius data or assert that the comparison
map is an R=T isomorphism.

## The Galois voice of *Opera Numerorum*

This directory is the modular voice in the Beal chamber. It gives the Frey
curve a residual representation, attaches Hecke and newform data, and names
the exact transport a Ribet-style descent would require. Its value is
structural: every edge says what data must travel, rather than allowing a
single opaque “modularity” label to stand in for the whole journey.

The v9.2.0 Level-26 evidence is upstream of this room. Finite quartic
congruences and replayed model data do not construct modular forms, establish
level lowering, or fill the support and transport suppliers described here.
Those interfaces therefore remain part of the conditional final theorem and
are not promoted by the new certificate work.
