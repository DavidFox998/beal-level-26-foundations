      Galois/08_RibetProof — conditional transport from newform support

      This file proves the formal last step from typed new-subspace support to
      the proposition `frey_level_lowering_of_unramified`: a supported new form
      already carries the lower-level realization witness required by that
      proposition.

      It does NOT prove the missing support theorem. The following mathematical
      results are still absent from the present Lean/Mathlib boundary and must
      be supplied before an unconditional Ribet theorem can be claimed:

      * a newform decomposition for the relevant mod-ℓ Hecke module;
      * a mod-ℓ Jacquet--Langlands / Ihara-lemma analogue that turns the
        unramified local condition into support at the divided level;
      * multiplicity one for the localized Hecke algebra 𝕋_𝔪, identifying the
        supported system of Hecke eigenvalues with the Frey residual
        representation.

      These omissions are deliberately neither `sorry` declarations nor global
      axioms. The support premise below is an explicit mathematical hypothesis.

/-- Conditional final transport for one level-lowering step.

    The mathematical work deferred to the three results named in this file's
    header is exactly the proof of `hSupport`. Once that explicit support
    hypothesis is available, `SupportInNewSubspace` contains a finite new form
    at level `M` realizing `R`, which is the conclusion of the existing
    level-lowering proposition.

    This is not an unconditional Ribet theorem and does not itself construct
    B15's enriched per-edge Galois witness. -/
