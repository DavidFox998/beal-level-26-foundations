      Galois/04_LevelLowering — the level-lowering transport boundary

      This file states the exact proposition that a genuine Ribet
      level-lowering theorem would need to establish. It deliberately defines
      the proposition instead of declaring an admitted theorem.

      Tate's local conclusion p ∣ N and p² ∤ N does NOT imply residual
      unramifiedness. The hypothesis `hUnram` is therefore explicit and
      separate. This preserves the odd-prime v4.1.0 boundary, including p = 3.

/-- The proposition required for one honest Ribet level-lowering step.

    The result keeps the same Frey model, residual prime, and representation.
    It asks only for a mod-ℓ form at the divided level whose finite
    q-expansion realizes the same representation. No proof of this
    proposition is supplied here. -/

  This is the Ribet transport statement. A future proof must supply, rather
  than assume silently, the missing Hecke-algebra and newform premises. In
  proof-outline form those obligations are:

    have hHecke : HeckeAlgebraLevelLoweringData model ℓ N p M := ...
    have hNewform : NewformAtLevel M W' := ...
    have hTransport :
        ModLRealizesRepresentation W' R := ...

  These types are intentionally not declared here: Hecke algebra, newform,
  and complex-analytic cusp-form infrastructure are not present in Mathlib
  v4.12 at this boundary. In particular, this definition is not an axiom and
  does not construct B15's enriched per-edge Galois witness.
