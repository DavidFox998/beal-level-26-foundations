# v4.8.0 Frey modularity *name* (exponent 13)

Blueprint: the Frey curve attached to a coprime solution of
`A^13 + B^13 = C^13` is an elliptic curve over `ℚ`, and
Wiles--Taylor modularity would produce a cuspidal eigenform
of weight 2.  Residual level lowering (Ribet) would then
target level `26 = 2 × 13`.

Mathlib 4.12 has no modularity theorem and no Frey-curve
constructor.  `FreyCurve13` is a displayed triple.  The
predicate `Modularity` has no constructors; the only
inhabitant is the named computational assumption
`frey_modular_13`.

That axiom is **not** Wiles--Taylor.  It is secured by the
LMFDB / Cremona labels `26a1` / `26b1` (Weierstrass models
`[1,0,1,-5,-8]` and `[1,-1,1,-3,3]`) already archived in
`Descent_26.json`.  This file does not prove modularity and
does not construct a Galois representation.

`freyLevel26_computational` is the displayed identity
`2 * 13 = 26`, the same arithmetic as `Frey13.FreyLevel26`.
`frey_conductor_26` is the `Nat` `26`.

This file does **not** import
`BealTheoremFromMazurChain26` (cycle).
