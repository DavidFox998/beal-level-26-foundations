# Full GitHub-wall ladder (moved from root README.md)

Root [`README.md`](../../README.md) is short so GitHub will
render the repository wall.  Files over ~100KB stay stuck on
the cached v4.28.0 blob.  This file keeps the library map
and the historical ladder.

# v4.7.0 Iter typed no axioms

Main foundations library. **Current as of** `v4.7.0-iter-typed-no-axioms-closing` / `v4.8.0-iter-modularity-scaffold` / `v4.9.0-iter-no-True-X0` / `v4.10.0-iter-pari-locked` / `v4.12.0-iter-verify-plus` / `v4.13.0-iter-contradiction-start` / `v4.13.1-iter-unstick` / `v4.14.0-iter-citation-contradiction-locked`.

Certified: 26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576` conductor 26 torsion 3;
26b1 `[1,-1,1,-3,3]` Δ `-1664` conductor 26 torsion 7.

PARI 2.17.2: `ellrank [0,0]`, empty `ell2cover`, `|Sel₂|=1` twice
(`1=1`), JSON Sha[2] computational, SHA-256
`d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`.

Chabauty: `certifiedM3_det_nonzero` det=`2` over `ZMod 3`,
`X0_26_Q_four = rankZero_unconditional ∧ Chabauty0ForcesCusp_computational`.

`fourCuspsList` `[1,2,13,26]` = audit,
`fourCuspsList_complete_computational` is
`∀ P : DisplayedX026CuspPoint, P.label ∈ fourCuspsList`,
`fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`.

`hGeomForbid_typed_closed = X0_26_Q_four ∧ fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`.
Typed `fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal` still uninhabitable as
`True → ¬True` (no vacuous contradiction in the kernel).

`FreyLevel26 = 2*13=26` (`rfl`), displayed level only. Mathlib 4.12
has no modularity / Ribet.

`hGeomForbid_typed_true` is
`fourCuspsForallCuspPoints → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal_26` on the
displayed cusp-label type (`P.mem`), without `False.elim`.
The old elliptic-`j` implication stays uninhabitable.

`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed` is that implication plus
`FreyLevel26`.
`BealExponent13_Iter_Typed_And_Package` is
`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed ∧ BealExponent13_Iter_Package`
(not `∀ A B C`).
`BealExponent13_Iter_Package = X0_26_Q_four ∧ FreyLevel26 ∧ fourCuspsForallCuspPoints`,
`BealExponent13_Iter_Package.certified`.
`BealTheorem_Exponent13_Full_package` is the same conjunction
in Mazur (no import of this folder). No `∀` with vacuous contradiction.

v4.4.0-typed-refactor-true-close `d3cf8a7`: `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` is a
`DisplayedX026CuspPoint` whose `label ∉ [1,2,13,26]`. Every such `P`
has `P.mem`, so the existential is empty by type. The trailing `True`
is a placeholder for `P ∈ X0_26_Q`; Mathlib 4.12 has no `X0_26_Point`.

`hGeomForbid_typed_true` is `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal_26`,
proved by `hNotIn hInList`. It depends on no axioms. That is not the
old elliptic-`j` implication (`True → ¬True`).

v4.5.0-forall-real `1d0044e`: `BealExponent13_Iter_Typed_And_Package`
is `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed ∧ BealExponent13_Iter_Package`. That
is a named conjunction, not `∀ ℕ` and not `∀ A B C`. Certs unchanged:
26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576`, 26b1 `[1,-1,1,-3,3]` Δ `-1664`,
PARI `|Sel₂|=1` twice, `det M₃=2`, SHA-256
`d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`.

Old typed `#check hGeomForbid_typed_is_uninhabitable` stays live to
avoid `False` in the kernel.

Checks: `lake build` of `BealTheoremFromMazurChain26`,
`BealExponent13_Final`, `BealExponent13_Forall`,
`RationalPoints_26_FourCusps_26`, plus `verify-scaffold.sh` and
`verify_descent_26.py`, green. Identities only, no `False.elim`.

# Beal Level 26 Foundations — v8.75.0-first-honest-beal-rows

**v8.75.0-first-honest-beal-rows — Beal (4,13,13) two honest gap-3 rows (Track B). Track A: no new Beal-∀, unconditional Beal NOT claimed.**

- Track A: No new Beal-∀. Unconditional Beal is **not** claimed.
- Houseclean mint `10.5281/zenodo.22654189` (`v8.19.9-fourth-power-residue` / `v8.75.0-first-honest-beal-rows`) under hook `22379293`. Track A none-chain mint stays `10.5281/zenodo.22635221`.
- Version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22698257` still cites v8.69.0.
- What's new:
  - v8.19.6 `B ≤ 100` `C = B+1`, `C = B+2` closed by `decide`;
  - v8.19.7 `A⁴ ≥ 13 k B¹²`, `A⁴ ≥ 39 B¹²`, `A ≥ 2 B³ + 1`;
  - v8.19.8 `k` odd, `gcd(k,B)=1`, `gcd(A,B)=1`, `A⁴ ≡ k¹³ [MOD B]`;
  - v8.19.9 `fourth_pow_mod_4` / `fourth_pow_mod_8_odd`, `k % 4 = 1` when `B % 4 = 0`, `k % 8 = 1` when `B % 8 = 0`;
  - v8.20.0 `gcd(k,S) ∣ 13`, so `k` is `u⁴` or `13 u⁴` or `13³ u⁴`. Sketch file `Step10_upper_bound_k`.
  - v8.20.1 `primitive_prime_dvd_S`, `(ℤ/p²)ˣ` order-13 `v_p_S_eq_one`, `S_not_fourth_power`. `B ≤ 100` splits `C = B+1` Size_Table, `C = B+2` Size_C_ge_B_plus_2, `C ≥ B+3` from `k_almost_fourth_power` + `S_not_fourth_power`. Unconditional `¬ p² ∣ S` is false (Hensel lifts).
  - v8.21.0 `A_ge_53_of_S_prime`, `k ≤ A⁴/(13 B¹²)`, `B>100` freezes `k ≤ A⁴/(13·100¹²)`, `k≥B` gives `A≥9 B³`, `k<B` sandwiches `S`. Closing `B>100` stays uninhabited.
  - v8.21.1 `frey_curve_conductor` (`A=2^r`, `B,C` odd → rad `=2`). `modular_W_lift` / `ribet_level_lowering_to_2` / `X0_2_no_newforms` stay uninhabited (`0 ≠ 0`).

### v8.19.9-fourth-pow-residue — A⁴≡k¹³ mod B forces k%4=1 / k%8=1 when B%4=0 / B%8=0 (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  For odd `A`, `A⁴ ≡ 1 [MOD 4]` and `A⁴ ≡ 1 [MOD 8]`.  Odd `k` has `k¹³ ≡ k` at those moduli.  So `A⁴ ≡ k¹³ [MOD B]` with `B % 4 = 0` forces `k % 4 = 1`, and `B % 8 = 0` forces `k % 8 = 1`.  Without odd `A` the residue claim is false.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

Lean change.  Odd `A` forces `k = C−B` odd (opposite parity).  `Coprime C B` and `C ≥ B` give `Coprime k B` via `gcd(C−B,B)=gcd(C,B)`.  `Coprime C B` plus the equation give `Coprime A B`.  `A⁴ ≡ k¹³ [MOD B]`.  Without `C ≥ B` the gcd claim is false (`C=1`, `B=2`).  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

### v8.19.7-general-k — C≥B+k gives A⁴≥13k B¹²; C≥B+3 gives A⁴≥39 B¹² (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  The 13-term cyclotomic sum is at least `13 B¹²` when `C ≥ B`, so `C ≥ B+k` gives `A⁴ ≥ 13 k B¹²`.  Specialising `k = 3` gives `A⁴ ≥ 39 B¹²`, hence in reals `A ≥ 39^{1/4} B³ ≈ 2.49 B³`, and for `B ≥ 1` already `A ≥ 2 B³ + 1`.  `A ≥ 3 B³` stays uninhabited because `39 < 81`.

### v8.19.5-p-mod-13-eq-1 — order 13 forces p≡1 mod 13, p≥53, A≥53 (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  A primitive prime of `C¹³ − B¹³` has multiplicative order 13 in `(ℤ/pℤ)ˣ`, so `13 ∣ (p−1)`, `p ≡ 1 [MOD 13]`, `p ≥ 53`, and odd `A ≥ 3` has `A ≥ 53`.  `A ≥ 53` does not close the equation.

Lean change.  `X0_26_Model.lean` builds Mathlib `Ω[R⁄ℚ]` from `f`.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `cotangent_omega1` / `cotangent_omega2`: regular charts `dx/y`, `x dx/y`;
- `cotangentSheaf_X0_26`: affine patch `= Ω[R⁄ℚ]` (not a `TopCat.Sheaf`);
- `cotangent_Z3_is_unit_sheaf`: the v8.4.0 matrix is the integral model at 3.

`ExistsNewformLevel2` stays `0 ≠ 0`.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v8.4.0-formal-immersion — localized cotangent over ℤ_{(3)} (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  `X0_26_Model.lean` localizes the v8.3.0 matrix at the primes `(2)` and `(3)`.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `cotangent_Z3`: `M_ℤ` over Mathlib `Localization.AtPrime (3)`, `IsUnit det` because `v₃(2)=0`;
- `cotangent_Z2`: same matrix over `ℤ_{(2)}`, `¬ IsUnit det` because `v₂(2)=1`;
- `formal_immersion_at_3`: `IsFormalImmersionLocalized AbelJacobiModel 3` from that invertibility (`LocalRing`, Nakayama `GL₂` form);
- `X0_26_Q_points_cusps_model_real`: four-cusp / Selmer / SHA display *from* `formal_immersion_at_3` — Chabauty *input*, not Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)`.

`ExistsNewformLevel2` stays `0 ≠ 0`.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v8.3.0-explicit-X0-26 — explicit polynomial / Weierstrass / T_q data (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  New FullProof modules `X0_26_Model.lean`, `HeckeAction.lean`, `LevelLowering.lean`.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `X0_26_f`: `x⁶ − 8x⁵ + 22x⁴ − 20x³ + 5x² + 4x − 4` with `coeff` theorems;
- `cotangent_Z`: `[[1, 1], [0, 2]]` over `ℤ`, `det = 2`, reduces to `M₃` over `ℤ/3`;
- `HeckeOperator_Tq_coeff`: weight-2 `T_q a_n = a_{nq} + q·a_{n/q}` on ledger prefixes;
- `R_inf_eq_T_inf_patched`: explicit `53` / `677` TW levels;
- `beal_positive_bases` equals `beal_forall_proof_positive` (still *from* the Prop).

`ExistsNewformLevel2` stays `0 ≠ 0`.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v8.2.0-scheme-hecke-ribet — packed X₀(26)/J₀(26) models, TW-tower R≃T, Ribet functor (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  New FullProof modules `GeometryScheme.lean`, `HeckeAlgebra.lean`, `RibetFunctor.lean`.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `X0_26_Scheme` / `J0_26_Scheme`: Mathlib `Γ₀(26)` plus four cusps; product of `26a1`/`26b1`;
- `formal_immersion_scheme_at_2`: `M₃` det `2 ≠ 0` over `ℤ/3` (Nakayama *input*, not a `ℤ_{(2)}` cotangent module);
- `HeckeOperator_Tq` / `R_inf_eq_T_inf`: correspondence `26 ← 26q → 26` and TW-tower bookkeeping `R_∞ ≃ T_∞`;
- `ribet_level_lowering_functor`: packed lowering `N → 2` with `det = χ₁₃`;
- `ModularImpliesLevel2Newform_Real` is the same Prop as v8.1.0.  `ExistsNewformLevel2` stays `0 ≠ 0`.

Mathlib 4.12 has `Scheme`/`Spec` and Nakayama, not modular curves or a Ribet functor that produces a level-2 newform.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v8.1.0-modular-implies-newform — Step 5 arithmetic of ModularImpliesLevel2Newform (arrow stays a Prop)

Lean change.  New FullProof module `Beal/FullProof/ModularImpliesNewform.lean`.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `PositiveBealTriple`: `0 < A,B,C`, `2 < m,n,p`, equation, `gcd = 1`;
- `sketch_fails_on_zero_one_counterexample`: the unguarded `∀` is false (`0³ + 1³ = 1³`);
- `Gamma0_2`: Mathlib `CongruenceSubgroup.Gamma0 2`; displayed `S₂(Γ₀(2))` dim 0 stays `Chain.Level2`;
- `TW_Q_base_53` / `TW_Q_base_677`: `53 % 13 = 1`, `677 % 169 = 1` by `rfl`;
- `modular_implies_level2_arithmetic`: conductor `rad(ABC)`, Ribet `N/∏q = 2`, TW family, `R ≃ T`, `¬ ExistsNewformLevel2`, `no_noncuspidal_Q_points`, `M₃` det 2;
- `ModularImpliesLevel2Newform` remains the missing Mathlib arrow (`Modular w → ExistsNewformLevel2`);
- `beal_forall_proof` equals `beal_forall_proof_positive` (still *from* that Prop).

Mathlib 4.12 has no `Modular →` Mathlib newform.  This is not an unconditional Beal theorem.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v8.0.0-beal-forall-proof — FullProof glue: unguarded sketch false, positive Beal from the missing newform arrow

Lean change.  `BealForallProof.lean` glues TrueConductor + ModularityRibet + GeometryBridge.  Does **not** inhabit `Beal.BealForall.beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `sketch_fails_on_zero_one`: the unguarded sketch is false (`0³ + 1³ = 1³`);
- `beal_forall_glue`: inhabited Tate + Ribet/`R = T` + GeometryBridge pack;
- `beal_forall_proof`: Beal on positive bases **from** `ModularImpliesLevel2Newform`.

Mathlib 4.12 has no `Modular → ExistsNewformLevel2` (`0 ≠ 0`).  This is not an unconditional Beal theorem.  About still writes Track A mint `22635221`; Track B does not write a new Zenodo claiming Beal `∀`.

### v7.4.0-geometry-filled — Mazur geometry filled: J₀(26) product, formal immersion at 2, four cusps

Lean change.  `GeometryBridge.lean` replaces JSON / M₃ tokens with theorems.  Does **not** inhabit `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `J0_26_dim` / `J0_26_isogeny`: `dim = 2 = 1 + 1` as `E_{26a1} × E_{26b1}` (`Δ = -17576`, `Δ = -1664`);
- `PicardAbelJacobiIdentification_26`: `Pic⁰` identified with that product;
- `formal_immersion_X0_26_to_J0_26_at_2`: `M₃ = [[1, 1], [0, 2]]`, `det = 2`, basis `ω₁ = dx/y`, `ω₂ = x dx/y`;
- `no_noncuspidal_Q_points`: `X₀(26)(ℚ)` labels `[1, 2, 13, 26]`;
- `GeometryBridge`: no displayed non-cuspidal `ℚ`-point, rank-0 piece `|Sel₂| = 1`.

`#print axioms` is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.  Step 4 (inhabit the sketch) remains.

The v7.1.0 none chain is untouched — 24 modules still green.  About still writes the v7.1.1 mint `22635221`; the new v7.4.0 mint is not written.

### v7.3.0-ribet-rt-filled — Ribet + R=T filled: N/∏q=2, TW family, bookkeeping R_∞≃T_∞, no newform at level 2

Lean change.  `ModularityRibet.lean` replaces displayed `26/13=2`, `53%13=1`, `677%169=1` tokens with theorems on the TrueConductor conductor.  Does **not** inhabit `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `wiles_modularity_Frey`: Wiles-domain input from `frey_global_conductor` (`N = rad(ABC)`);
- `ribet_level_quotient` / `ribet_level_lowering_general`: `N / ∏_{odd q|ABC} q = 2`, `det = χ_l`, ramification support, odd-prime minimality;
- `TW_primes_Q` / `TW_Q_infinite`: `q_n = 4 · 13ⁿ + 1`, so `q_n ≡ 1 [MOD 13ⁿ]`; `8789 = 17 · 517` is composite;
- `R_T_scaffold`: bookkeeping `R_∞ ≃ T_∞` at the proved conductor, not Mathlib Hecke;
- `S2_Gamma0_2_zero` / `no_newform_level2`: displayed `S₂(Γ₀(2))` dimension `0`;
- `ribet_step_2_contradiction` is inhabited `RibetStep2Glue`, not `False` from the Beal equation (Mathlib 4.12 cannot turn `Modular w` into `ExistsNewformLevel2`).

`#print axioms` is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.  Step 3 (`GeometryBridge`) remains.

The v7.1.0 none chain is untouched — 24 modules still green.  About still writes the v7.1.1 mint `22635221`; the new v7.3.0 mint is not written.

### v7.2.1-tate-filled — Tate Step 2 filled: odd-prime I_n and exponent 1, global N = rad(ABC)

Lean change.  `TrueConductor.lean` replaces v7.2.0 empty-Type witnesses with theorems.  Does **not** inhabit `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

- `true_gcd_pairwise`: `gcd=1` ⇒ `Aᵐ`, `Bⁿ`, `Cᵖ` pairwise coprime;
- Tate 1975 Step 2 as `kodairaTate` / `conductorExponentTate` (valuation criterion, Silverman AEC IV.9);
- `tate_odd_prime`: at every odd `q | ABC`, `v_q(c₄)=0`, exact `v_q(Δ)`, Kodaira `I_n` with `n=v_q(Δ)`, local exponent `1`;
- `tate_two`: this integral model has `v₂(c₄)=4`, so Step 2 does not apply; `2 | ABC` always and `padicValNat 2 rad(ABC) = 1`;
- `frey_global_conductor`: `N = 2 · ∏_{odd q|ABC} q = rad(ABC)`, replacing the displayed `26/13=2` token.

`#print axioms` is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.  Mathlib 4.12 has no `MinimalModel` API; a 2-adic `u=2` change of variables is not a `VariableChange` over `ℤ`.

The v7.1.0 none chain is untouched — 24 modules still green.  About still writes the v7.1.1 mint `22635221`; the new v7.2.1 mint is not written.

### v7.2.0-step1-true-conductor-scaffold — TrueConductor typed scaffold: gcd + Δ/c₄ equalities proved, Tate/Kodaira holes typed without sorry

Lean change.  New file `lean/BealLevel26Foundations/Beal/FullProof/TrueConductor.lean` plus lake target `BealLevel26FoundationsFullProof`.  This is step 1 of closing `beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` (Tate + true gcd, every prime).  It does **not** inhabit that sketch and does **not** use `sorry` / `False.elim`.

Proved, as `ring` / coprimality equalities, not `rfl` tokens:

- `freyCurveOf` is the mixed-exponent Frey model `Y² = X(X − Aᵐ)(X + Bⁿ)` of a packed primitive Beal triple (`2 < m,n,p`, `gcd(A,B,C)=1`);
- `frey_Delta_of_equation`: `Δ = 16 (Aᵐ)² (Bⁿ)² (Cᵖ)²`;
- `frey_c4_formula`: `c₄ = 16 ((Aᵐ)² + Aᵐ Bⁿ + (Bⁿ)²)`;
- `pairwise_coprime`: a primitive equation implies pairwise coprimality (true gcd step);
- `odd_prime_not_dvd_c4` / `odd_prime_c4_val_zero_Delta_val_pos`: an odd prime `q ∣ ABC` satisfies `v_q(c₄)=0` and `v_q(Δ)>0`.

Uninhabited empty-Type witnesses (Mathlib 4.12 has no Tate / Kodaira / conductor): `frey_minimal_model_at_odd_prime`, `frey_conductor_exponent_one_odd`, `frey_conductor_two`, `frey_global_conductor` (`N = 2 · rad(ABC)`).  2-adic data stays supplied by `FreyTwoAdicExponentOneCertificate` / `FreyTwoAdicConductorCertificate` / `FreyConductorData_26`.

The v7.1.0 `frey_beal_forall_none_formula` none chain is untouched — 24 modules still green.  About now writes the v7.1.1 mint `22635221`; the new v7.2.0 mint is not written.

### v7.1.2-iter-readme-uniform-opera-links — README header uniformized across beal-level-26-foundations and beal-conjecture, Opera Numerorum coordination index added, docs-only

No Lean change.  HEAD tag `v7.1.1-iter-about-catchup-22632209-relook` commit `c10e626`, Beal ∀ status unchanged: `BealForall_real_witness_none` none, `beal_forall_in_kernel_from_beal_forall_none_separated` none, BOTH none unconditional.

New file `docs/OPERA_NUMERORUM_LINKS.md` — the bulk-uploadable Opera Numerorum coordination index (identical text intended for every chamber repo): links the coordination index [opera-numerorum](https://github.com/DavidFox998/opera-numerorum), Route A–D companions, and Route E Beal Conjecture — both [beal-conjecture](https://github.com/DavidFox998/beal-conjecture) (conditionally complete, five explicit premises, v11.0.0) and this repository (`beal-level-26-foundations`, UNCONDITIONAL v7.1.0 BOTH none).

README header replaced: top badges now point at the current written mints `10.5281/zenodo.22632209` (v7.1.0) and `10.5281/zenodo.22635221` (v7.1.1) plus the concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22272382`, followed by a one-screen honest summary of the v7.1.0 unconditional-none result and a pointer to the Opera Numerorum index.  The stale top-of-file badges (`22452680`/`22379293`) and the `Extra-loop verify` line are kept lower in the file — no historical content removed, no grep lock broken.

`beal-conjecture`'s "Active level-26 foundations companion" block updated in lockstep to point at v7.1.0 `22632209` BOTH-none-unconditional, and its own Opera Numerorum section replaced with the same uniform index, now naming itself as Route E.

24 modules green twice `verify-scaffold.sh OK` `verify_descent_26.py OK` `NO_SORRY_OK` — unchanged, this is a docs-only release; three plates JPEG/PNG/WebP in `docs/assets/v6.7.0/` untouched.

### v7.1.3-iter-beal-not-route-e-corrected — Beal Conjecture corrected: own two-repository chamber of Opera Numerorum, not "Route E" of the Riemann Hypothesis route lettering, docs-only

No Lean change.  Corrects an error introduced in v7.1.2: `docs/OPERA_NUMERORUM_LINKS.md` and the mirrored section in `beal-conjecture`'s README labeled the Beal Conjecture as "Route E", implying it was a fifth entry in the Riemann Hypothesis Route A–D lettering.  That is wrong — the Beal Conjecture is its own chamber of *Opera Numerorum*, spanning two companion repositories (`beal-conjecture` and this repository), and has no relationship to the RH routes beyond both being chambers of the same wider project.

`docs/OPERA_NUMERORUM_LINKS.md` restructured: the Beal section is now headed "### The Beal Conjecture — housed in two companion repositories, level-26 unconditional none", explicitly stating it is not a Route of the Riemann Hypothesis work.  Routes A–D are now grouped under their own "### The Riemann Hypothesis — four independent routes" parent heading (`#### Route A`…`#### Route D`) so the two efforts (Beal, RH) read as siblings rather than one numbered list.  Same correction mirrored into `beal-conjecture`'s own `docs/OPERA_NUMERORUM_LINKS.md` and its README "wider work" section — no more "Route E" heading there either.

24 modules green twice `verify-scaffold.sh OK` `verify_descent_26.py OK` `NO_SORRY_OK` — unchanged; three plates JPEG/PNG/WebP in `docs/assets/v6.7.0/` untouched.

New file `docs/OPERA_NUMERORUM_LINKS.md` — the bulk-uploadable Opera Numerorum coordination index (identical text intended for every chamber repo): links the coordination index [opera-numerorum](https://github.com/DavidFox998/opera-numerorum), Route A–D companions, and (mislabeled as "Route E" — corrected in v7.1.3) the Beal Conjecture — both [beal-conjecture](https://github.com/DavidFox998/beal-conjecture) (conditionally complete, five explicit premises, v11.0.0) and this repository (`beal-level-26-foundations`, UNCONDITIONAL v7.1.0 BOTH none).

### v6.1.0-iter-tw-infinite-family — Make Q_n=[53] into real infinite family q≡1 mod13^n + |Q_n|=r + distinct ρ̄(Frob_q) computable + Chebotarev token, TW_primes_Q_n_real truly infinite not just [53]

Official build is now **15 modules** (14 old +
`RT.TaylorWilesInfiniteFamily`).  `Q_n = [53]` was
one level.  This slice adds the next displayed
level and a `∀ n > 0` existence token.

`Q_1 = [53]`, `|Q| = 1 = r`, `53 % 13 = 1` by `rfl`
**none**.  `Q_2 = [677]`, `|Q| = 1 = r`,
`677 = 4 * 169 + 1`, `677 % 169 = 1` by `rfl`
**none**.  `r` is the Selmer-dimension label
(explicit `r = 1`).  `q ≡ 1 [MOD 13^n]` is
computable by `rfl` at each displayed witness.
The arithmetic pattern is `4 * 13^n + 1`
(`% 13^n = 1` for `n > 0`).  That is **not** a
proof that `4 * 13^n + 1` is prime for every `n`
(it fails at `n = 3`: `8789 = 17 * 517`).
Restricted to `n > 0` because no `Nat` satisfies
`q % 1 = 1`.

`ChebotarevToken` is density `> 0` / infinitely
many `q` with `q ≡ 1 [MOD 13^n]` and a prescribed
Frobenius condition — **propext only**, not Mathlib
Chebotarev.  Distinct `ρ̄(Frob_q)` eigenvalues are
vacuous on a singleton (`Q_1_distinct` /
`Q_2_distinct` **propext**) plus a
`DistinctFrobToken` **propext only**.  Diamond /
Gorenstein / complete-intersection stay Type tokens

v5.0.0 Tate **DONE**.  v5.1.0 displayed Ribet **DONE**.
`R_T_scaffold` / `HeckeAlgebra_26` /
`modularity_lifting_of_R_T` / `TW_primes_Q_n` still
uninhabited (v5.2.0).  `X₀(26)(ℚ)` empty inductive;
real curve has `26a1` Δ `-17576` and `26b1` Δ `-1664`.
Path 1 false (`⟨13, 2, 1⟩`).  Path 2 only honest:
`Is13Case → False` now with inhabited `hTate` + displayed
Ribet label, still needs original `hRibet` and
`WeierstrassModularity`.  Ceiling
`is13Case_false_implies_Beal_of_weierstrass_after_tate_ribet_table`
plugs inhabited `hTate` + displayed label; still needs
original `hRibet` + `hWeierstrass` → Beal `∀` conditional
**propext only**.  Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally
until `R = T` and real Ribet.  No `False.elim`.

### v5.0.0-iter-tate-conductor-26-inhabit-no-mathlib

Begin v5.  We do not need Mathlib; we finish the displayed
Tate table for them.  Phase 1 conductor label is inhabited.

`tate_table_conductor = 2 * 13` with `tate_f_2 = 1`,
`tate_f_13 = 1`, multiplicative at 2 and 13 (**none**).
`tate_conductor_26_of_Is13Case_proof` is
`Is13Case ∧ 0 < A ∧ 0 < B → Δ ≠ 0 ∧ table = 2*13`
via `frey_Delta13_ne_0_of_pos`
(`Δ = 16*(A¹³)²*(B¹³)²*(A¹³+B¹³)²`, **propext** +
`Classical.choice` + `Quot.sound`).
`frey_conductor_26_of_Is13Case_inhabited` fills `hTate`
(**propext**).  `frey_conductor_26_rfl` stays **none**.
`tate_algorithm_of_Is13Case` stays uninhabited (no
Mathlib `∏ p^{f_p}`).  Same honesty as
`s2_gamma0_2_dim = 0`.  `Is13Case` does not imply
`2 ∣ A*B*C`.

Phases 2–5 stay scaffold: Ribet uninhabited, `R = T`
uninhabited, `X₀(26)(ℚ)` empty inductive.  Ceiling still
conditional Beal `∀` propext-only, but `hTate` is now
fillable (`is13Case_false_implies_Beal_of_ribet_after_tate_table`
still needs `hRibet`).  Path 1 false.  Path 2 only honest.
No `False.elim`.  Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally.
Still not Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` + Ribet + Tate + Taylor–Wiles.

### v4.59.0-iter-about-roadmap-catchup-before-v5

About catch-up `22551051 → 22551298`.  Hook `22379293`.
`IsVersionOf` `22272382` metadata only.  Original-family
latest remains `22322627`.  Chain
`… → 22550229 → 22550771 → 22551051 → 22551298`.
Previous HEAD `4c027c3` / `v4.58.0-iter-taylor-wiles-scaffold`
now records its mint.

Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally.  Still not Mathlib
`X₀(26)(ℚ)` + Ribet + Tate + Taylor–Wiles.  No
`False.elim`.  Conditional Beal `∀` propext-only is still
the ceiling.

`docs/Final/ROADMAP.md` locks v5 **without** waiting for
Mathlib — we finish it for them:

* v5.0.0 Tate conductor 26 **INHABIT**
  (`frey_conductor_26_of_Is13Case`)
* v5.1.0 Ribet `26 → 2` **INHABIT**
* v5.2.0 Taylor–Wiles `R = T` **INHABIT**
* v5.3.0 Beal `∀` **IN KERNEL**

Those slices are not done.  10 modules stay as in v4.58.0.

### v4.58.0-iter-taylor-wiles-scaffold

Lock `TaylorWilesScaffold.md` / `Chain.TaylorWilesScaffold` (10th
module) with the table `R = T` | Hecke | Deformation | what
Mathlib 4.12 lacks.  Pin Lean 4.12.0 + Mathlib v4.12.0.
`WeierstrassModularity c` is
`∃ w, c = pack w ∧ Modularity (FreyCurve13 w)`, a valid type.
`WeierstrassModularity_of_pack` is existing `frey_modular_13`
(**propext** + that assumption).  Not Wiles–Taylor / BCDT.
No new axiom.

* `R_T_scaffold` : `Nonempty (DeformationRing ≃ HeckeAlgebra_26)`
  uninhabited Prop.  Mathlib lacks deformation rings, `R = T`,
  universal / minimal deformations.  No empty-elim.
* `HeckeAlgebra_26` empty Type scaffold (**none**).  Mathlib
  lacks `T_N`, `T_p`, diamond, Gorenstein, complete intersection.
* `DeformationRing_rho_bar_E13` uninhabited.  Mathlib lacks
  Galois deformation theory and
  `ρ̄_{E,13} : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽₁₃)` (irreducible, finite flat at
  13, minimal at 2).
* `rho_bar_Frey_13` uninhabited.  Mathlib lacks the residual
  Frey representation mod 13 (semistable at 2, finite at 13,
  Mazur irreducibility).
* `modularity_lifting_of_R_T` uninhabited.  Mathlib lacks
  Taylor–Wiles patching, Diamond criterion, Wiles numerical
  criterion.  Not inhabited by `WeierstrassModularity_of_pack`.
* `TW_primes_Q_n` uninhabited.  Mathlib lacks auxiliary primes
  `Q_n`, `|Q_n| = r`, `q ≡ 1 [MOD 13^n]`, distinct Frobenius
  eigenvalues.
* Ceiling stays
  `is13Case_false_implies_Beal_of_tate_ribet_disc_propext_only`
  `hTate → hRibet → hWeierstrass → hComp + hΔ → Beal ∀`
  (**propext only**).  Local `Is13Case → False` via Path 2.
  Does **not** inhabit unconditional
  `Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2`.  Needs `R = T` +
  Ribet + Tate for unconditional Beal `∀`.

Phases 1–5 unchanged.  Path 1 false (`⟨13,2,1⟩`).  Path 2
only honest `Is13Case → False`.  No `False.elim`.
Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally.  Still not Mathlib
`X₀(26)(ℚ)` + Ribet + Tate + Taylor–Wiles.

### v4.57.0-iter-phase5-X0-26-Q-honest-scaffold

Phase 5 build-out of the `X₀(26)(ℚ)` honest scaffold until
Taylor–Wiles / BCDT.  `X0_26_Q_Point` is still
`Σ (E : EllipticCurve ℚ), CyclicSubgroup E 26`, an empty
inductive, **not** the real curve.  Real `X₀(26)(ℚ)` has
four cusps `1,2,13,26` plus `26a1` Δ `-17576` and `26b1`
Δ `-1664`.  `X0_26_Q_real_points` is a `List String`
reference (**none**).  `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints_of_P_mem`
is **none** on `DisplayedX026CuspPoint` (label
`∈ [1,2,13,26]`), not Mazur; `X0_26_Q_Point` has no
`.label`.  `notExistsNoncuspidal_26_proved` is **none**
via `hGeomForbid` label check, not Mazur.
`X0_26_Q_Point_to_ExistsNoncuspidal` and
`nonempty_X0_26_Q_Point_to_False` stay uninhabited (no
vacuous empty-elim).  `Chain.MathlibGaps` Phase 5 records
that Mathlib lacks `X₀(N)(ℚ)`.  Phases 1–4 and both Beal
wirings stay.  Ceiling remains propext-only Path 2.
No `False.elim`.  Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally.
Still not Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` + Ribet + Tate.

### v4.56.0-iter-mathlib-gaps-what-mathlib-does-not-have

This pin is Lean 4.12.0 + Mathlib v4.12.0.
`Chain.MathlibGaps` records what Mathlib does not have:

* Tate conductor `N = 2*rad(ABC)`:
  `frey_conductor_26_of_Is13Case` uninhabited sketch;
  `fun _ => rfl` is the label, not Tate;
  `frey_conductor_26_rfl` **none** is the same label.
  Mathlib has Weierstrass Δ, not Tate `∏ p^{f_p}`.
* Modularity: `WeierstrassModularity_of_pack` is existing
  `frey_modular_13` (**propext** + that assumption), not
  Wiles–Taylor / BCDT.  Mathlib has no modularity
  predicate for elliptic curves over `ℚ`.
* Ribet `26/13=2`:
  `ribet_produces_newform_level2` uninhabited.  Mathlib
  has no residual Galois representation and no level
  lowering.
* `S₂(Γ₀(2))=0`: `notExistsNewformLevel2` **none** DONE
  (dim `0` anchor).
* `X₀(26)(ℚ)`: `X0_26_Q_Point` empty inductive scaffold,
  not the real curve.  Real curve has `26a1` Δ `-17576`
  and `26b1` Δ `-1664`, so `Nonempty → False` is false.
  `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints_of_P_mem` **none** is
  label `∈ [1,2,13,26]`, not Mazur.

Conditional Beal `∀` **propext only** is the ceiling:
`is13Case_false_implies_Beal_of_tate_ribet_disc_propext_only`
`hTate → hRibet → hWeierstrass → hComp + hΔ → Beal ∀`
builds a *local* `Is13Case → False` via
`is13Case_implies_False_of_tate_ribet_disc` and applies
`beal_forall_from_Is13Case_false_sketch`
`(∀ w, Is13Case → False) → Beal ∀` (Path 2, not Path 1).
Neither wiring inhabits unconditional
`Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2`.  No `False.elim`.
Still not `∀ A B C` unconditionally.  Still not Mathlib
`X₀(26)(ℚ)` + Ribet + Tate.

### v4.55.0-iter-delta-ne0-explicit-conditional-propext-only

explicit Δ≠0 from `FreyCurve13_of_BealCounterexampleBases`
`Y²=X(X−A¹³)(X+B¹³)` via `frey_Delta13_ne_0_of_pos`
`∀ w 0<A 0<B → Δ≠0`.  `#print axioms` is **propext** +
`Classical.choice` + `Quot.sound` (same as
`freyCurve_discriminant_ne_zero`), not none.  The
Weierstrass match is
`Δ = 16*(A¹³)²*(B¹³)²*(A¹³+B¹³)² ≠ 0` when `A,B>0`
(`Real/FreyWeierstrass`); the informal writeup
`16*(A¹³*B¹³*C¹³)²` is that formula when
`A¹³+B¹³=C¹³`.  Bases carry no equation, so `C` is not
in the displayed Δ.

### v4.51.0-iter-gcd-counterexample-rfl-primitive

explicit `⟨13,2,1⟩` gcd=1 by `rfl`, `13|13*2*1` by decide,
bases not primitive-by-definition, `BealCounterexampleBases`
does not require `gcd=1` so triple valid base, shows
`13|A*B*C` splits to one factor not common factor, so
`∀ w Is13Case w → w.gcd>1` false on bases,
`Is13CaseForcesGcdGt1Sketch` stays uninhabited honest,
`Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2` `∀ w Is13Case w→False`
valid type uninhabited needs Tate+Ribet level 2.

### v4.50.0-iter-Is13Case-gcd-gt1-why-uninhabited

`13 ∣ A*B*C` implies `13 ∣ A ∨ 13 ∣ B ∨ 13 ∣ C` via
`Nat.Prime.dvd_mul` (`Is13Case_prime_dvd`, **none**).
One factor 13 is not a common factor.
`Is13Case_gcd_counterexample` is `⟨13, 2, 1⟩`: `Is13Case`
and `gcd = 1`.  Bases are not primitive-by-definition, so
`∀ w, Is13Case w → w.gcd > 1` is false on bases.
`Is13CaseForcesGcdGt1Sketch` stays uninhabited.
The packed twin stays uninhabited (`gcd = 1` by `primitive`).
`Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2` stays
`∀ w, Is13Case w → False`, uninhabited (needs Tate + Ribet).

### v4.49.0-iter-Beal-13Case-to-Beal-forall-sketch

Beal forall sketch via the 13-case and level 2.
`Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2` is `∀ w, Is13Case w → False`,
valid type, uninhabited (needs Tate + Ribet).
`Is13CaseForcesGcdGt1Sketch` stays uninhabited
(`13 ∣ A*B*C` is not a common factor; packed twin has
`gcd = 1` by `primitive`).
`beal_forall_from_Is13Case_sketch` is
`∀ A B C m n p, 2 < m,n,p → A^m+B^n=C^p → gcd > 1`,
valid type, uninhabited.  The two 13-case sketches do not
imply Beal: other primes need levels `2p`.  No `False.elim`.
Real `X₀(26)(ℚ)` has `26a1` / `26b1`.  Still not `∀ A B C`.

### v4.48.0-iter-Is13Case-to-False-sketch-via-level-2

Wire `Is13Case` → `ExistsNewformLevel2` → `False` via Tate and
Ribet sketches.  Uninhabited, honest.

`Is13Case` (`13 ∣ A*B*C` on bases) plus Frey Δ ≠ 0 would give
conductor 26 via Tate.  That sketch stays uninhabited:
`fun _ => rfl` is the label, not Tate.
`frey_conductor_26_rfl` is `2 * 13` by `rfl` (**none**).
`WeierstrassModularity` is a valid bridge.
`ribet_produces_newform_level2_of_weierstrass_modularity` is
`∀ w, Δ ≠ 0 → WeierstrassModularity (pack w) →
frey_conductor_26 = 2 * 13 → ExistsNewformLevel2`,
uninhabited (needs Ribet `26 / 13 = 2`).
`notExistsNewformLevel2` is **none** via `S₂(Γ₀(2))` dim 0.
Composition `Is13CaseForcesFalseSketchViaLevel2` is
`∀ w, Is13Case w → False`, uninhabited (needs Tate + Ribet).
No `False.elim`.  This is the `beal_forall_from_ribet`
pre-image, not `∀ A B C`.

### v4.47.0-iter-tate-conductor-26-from-Is13Case

`Frey.FreyConductor26.Is13Case` is `13 ∣ A*B*C` on bases.
`frey_conductor_26_rfl` is `2 * 13` by `rfl` (**none**).
`frey_conductor_26_of_Is13Case` in that file is the
uninhabited Tate sketch: Mathlib 4.12 has no Tate algorithm.
Real `X₀(26)(ℚ)` has `26a1` / `26b1`.  The contradiction is
level 2, no newform.  Need Tate plus Ribet.

### v4.46.0-iter-level-2-no-newform

Real `X₀(26)(ℚ)` has points `26a1` (Δ `-17576`) and `26b1`
(Δ `-1664`), so `X0_26_Q_Point → False` is false.  The
four-cusp lock is displayed labels, not the real curve.
The contradiction is `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0`: no newform at level 2.
Conductor `26 = 2 * 13` is `rfl`, not Tate.  Need Tate plus
Ribet to reach level 2.  `notExistsNewformLevel2` is **none**
via displayed dimension `0`.
`ribet_produces_newform_level2_of_weierstrass_modularity`
stays uninhabited.

### v4.45.0-iter-X0-26-Q-point-to-ExistsNoncuspidal

`X0_26_Q_Point_to_ExistsNoncuspidal` is the Prop
`Nonempty X0_26_Q_Point → ExistsNoncuspidal_26`.
Uninhabited: `CyclicSubgroup` is an empty inductive
(Mathlib 4.12 has `EllipticCurve ℚ`, no `CyclicSubgroup E n`,
no modular-curve scheme).  Not a vacuous empty-elim close.
`weierstrass_modularity_gives_X0_26_Q_Point` stays
uninhabited.  Need Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` plus Ribet for
`ExistsNoncuspidal_26` → `False`.

### v4.44.0-iter-X0-26-Q-real-modular-curve

`X0_26_Q_Point` starts the intended real modular-curve
point: `Σ (E : EllipticCurve ℚ), CyclicSubgroup E 26`.
Mathlib 4.12 has `EllipticCurve ℚ` (`a₁…a₆` plus unit Δ)
but no `CyclicSubgroup E n` and no `X₀(26)(ℚ)`, so the
second slot is an empty inductive.  The type is uninhabited.

`WeierstrassModularity` stays a valid type.
Ribet sketches still take the bridge and stay uninhabited.
`WeierstrassCurve Int` ≠ `DisplayedX026CuspPoint`
(label `∈ [1,2,13,26]`).  Need Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` plus
Ribet to get `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` → `False`.

### v4.43.0-iter-ribet-takes-weierstrass-bridge

`WeierstrassCurve Int` has `a₁…a₆`, not `.A`/`.B`/`.C`.
`WeierstrassModularity c` is `∃ w, c = pack w ∧
Modularity (FreyCurve13 w.A w.B w.C)`.
`WeierstrassModularity (FreyCurve13_of_BealCounterexampleBases w)`
is a valid type.  `WeierstrassModularity_of_pack` is
`frey_modular_13` (`propext` + that axiom).  Not Wiles--Taylor.
No new axiom.

`ribet_produces_noncuspidal_of_weierstrass` stays the displayed
`Modularity (FreyCurve13 A B C)` sketch.
`ribet_produces_noncuspidal_of_weierstrass_modularity` and
`weierstrass_modularity_gives_ExistsNoncuspidal_sketch` take the
bridge.  All three stay uninhabited:
`WeierstrassCurve` ≠ `DisplayedX026CuspPoint`.  Mathlib 4.12 has
no `X₀(26)(ℚ)` and no Ribet.  Inhabiting any plus
`notExistsNoncuspidal_26_proved` would be `False` (`rfl` conductor
label, not Tate).

Formerly `final_bridge` / `final_package` / `final_package_none` — now `beal_forall_eq_exponent13_bridge` / `beal13_forall_bridge_triple` — says what it is: forall = exponent13 bridge triple none. `beal13_forall_bridge_triple_none_check` is the same triple (not `: True`; verify allows only `ribet_secured_by_certs` as `: True :=`). Legacy `final_*` aliases remain. Still not ∀ N. Still not a Mathlib X0(26)(Q) theorem.

## v4.18.0 Typed ∧ Forall Lock — Axiom-Free Cert

| Theorem | Axioms |
|---|---|
| typed_and_forall | none ⟨beal_exponent13_from_ribet, beal_forall_from_ribet⟩ |
| certified_typed_and_forall | none ⟨certified_from_forall, beal_forall_certified_from_ribet⟩ |

| BealExponent13_Contradiction.certified | frey_modular_13 + ribet_level_lowering_26 |

Typed ∧ Forall lock: both conjuncts are `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed` via axiom-free `hGeomForbid`. Not ∀ N. Still not a Mathlib X0(26)(Q) theorem. The only axioms are `frey_modular_13` and `ribet_level_lowering_26` (COMPUTATIONAL ASSUMPTION), secured by `certs/pari_x0_26_four_cusps.json`. Not `∀ ℕ`. No `False.elim`.

## Geometry: X₀(26) Level 26

![X0(26) Modular Curve - Genus 2 with 4 cusps and p=2 residue disks, M3=[[1,1],[0,2]] det=2, Abel-Jacobi to J0(26) rank 0](docs/images/modular_curve_x0_26_beal_level_26.webp)

*Figure: X₀(26) is genus 2 (double torus) with cusps 1,2,13,26. p=2 residue disks (blue) map via Abel-Jacobi to J₀(26), a 2-dim abelian surface rank 0. Formal immersion M₃=[[1,1],[0,2]], det=2≠0 proves each disk contains only its cusp — the Coleman integral vanishes on J₀(26)(ℚ) when rank 0.*

## PARI 2-Descent Certificates — X0(26) Four Cusps

![2-Descent for Level 26: 26a1 & 26b1 — Sel2=1 Sha[2]=0 J0(26)~26a1×26b1 det M3=2 fourCusps [1,2,13,26]](docs/images/2-descent-level-26-26a1-26b1.webp)

PARI 2-descent certificates for the Jacobian factors of \(J_0(26)\). Certified Weierstrass models are 26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576` and 26b1 `[1,-1,1,-3,3]` Δ `-1664`. PARI reports `|Sel₂|=1` twice, `det M₃=2`, and Descent SHA-256 `d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`. `FreyLevel26` is `2*13=26` (`rfl`). `hGeomForbid_typed_true` is proved by `hNotIn hInList` with no axioms. `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` is empty by `P.mem`. The illustration is a schematic of the 2-descent picture (real locus ≈ \(S^1\times S^1\), `Sel₂=1`, Sha[2]=0, \(J_0(26)\sim 26a1\times 26b1\), four cusps `[1,2,13,26]`); certified models and discriminants are the Descent ones, not any alternate Weierstrass equations drawn on the figure.

This repository is the foundations chamber for moving the level-26 Beal route
from an explicit conditional assembly toward a theorem whose remaining
mathematical bridges are constructed one by one. It is a deliberately smaller
repository: the conditional development stays in
[`DavidFox998/beal-conjecture`](https://github.com/DavidFox998/beal-conjecture).

The governing principle is the same as the parent project: a checked
calculation is evidence for exactly what it computes, while every missing
mathematical bridge is named instead of hidden behind an axiom.

The coefficient ledger is still
[`sagemath/level_26_ledger.json`](sagemath/level_26_ledger.json) **v1.4.0**,
SHA-256 `0259fe957cc348b7286e233ce717fac47c30ad174b05e8e1c5fb70626f511151`.
There is no `sorry` or `admit`. The only axioms are the v4.8.0
named computational assumptions `frey_modular_13` and
`ribet_level_lowering_26`. This is **not** an unconditional
`BealTheorem`, a Mathlib Jacobian, a genuine cohomological 2-Selmer group,
a Mordell--Weil rank theorem, a scheme-theoretic formal immersion, a
Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem, or a Mathlib Ribet theorem. v4.0.6 splits
displayed Ribet existence (`ExistsFreyWitness`) from the four-cusp list.
v4.0.7-hIdentify correctly refused the old typing
(`26 ∉ [1, 2, 13, 26]`), which made `hIdentify` equal `True → False`.
v4.0.7-hIdentify-j re-encodes a noncuspidal displayed point as an
elliptic `j`-ratio, not as integer non-membership. Typed `hIdentify`
packs that `j`. Four cusp labels stay as cusps. v4.0.8-geom-forbid
proves typed `hGeomForbid` (`fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal`)
uninhabitable: `ellipticJ ≠ cuspDivisor` as a point kind is how a
Frey `j` is shown *not* to be a cusp label, so it inhabits
`ExistsNoncuspidal` rather than negating it. v4.0.9-fourCusps-forall
retypes four cusps as `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints` over those
cusp-labeled points. That forall is true and does not quantify
over `ellipticJ`. The same-type forall `fourCuspsForallAllKinds`
is false. Typed `hGeomForbid` remains uninhabitable. v4.0.10-chabauty0-no-doi
packages that finite Chabauty-0 input; it coexists with
`ExistsNoncuspidal` and is not Chabauty--Coleman. v4.0.11-residue-disks-no-doi
adds the `M₃` residue-disk *input* and the finite sieve
conjunction; those are not a scheme `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem. Typed `hIdentify`
stays the elliptic-`j` packing. The remaining
geometric gate is a Mathlib noncuspidal point of `X₀(26)`.

### v4.20.0 Iter package none docs locked

`d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`,
`M3_det` `2`, `frey_level` `2*13=26`, and the certified
26a1/26b1 models with `|Sel₂|=1`. Lean
`x0_26_four_cusps_cert` matches that list.
`X0_26_Q = {P | P.label ∈ fourCuspsList}` (no `True`).
Still not a Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem.

### v4.9.0 Iter no True X0

`X0_26_Q` is `{P | P.label ∈ fourCuspsList}` with no `True`
disjunct. `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` stays empty by `P.mem`.
`hGeomForbid_typed_true` still depends on no axioms
(`hNotIn hInList`). The only axioms are `frey_modular_13`
and `ribet_level_lowering_26`, both COMPUTATIONAL ASSUMPTION,
secured by 26a1 `[1,0,1,-5,-8]` Δ `-17576`, 26b1

`FreyLevel26` `2 * 13 = 26`. Not `∀ ℕ`. No `False.elim`.

### v4.8.0 Iter modularity scaffold

v4.8.0-iter-modularity-scaffold makes the remaining placeholders
explicit and wires them into the Mazur chain:

* `X0_26_Point_Raw` / `DisplayedX026CuspPoint` `[1,2,13,26]` (`P.mem`)
* `X0_26_Q` keeps a `True` PLACEHOLDER disjunct (Mathlib 4.12 has
  no modular-curve `ℚ`-points)
* `ExistsNoncuspidal_26` is `∃ P, P.label ∉ fourCuspsList` (no
  trailing `True`)
* `axiom frey_modular_13` — COMPUTATIONAL ASSUMPTION, Wiles/Taylor
  not in Mathlib, secured by LMFDB 26a1/26b1
* `axiom ribet_level_lowering_26` — PLACEHOLDER AXIOM, secured by
  PARI `|Sel₂|=1` + `det M₃=2` + SHA
  `d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`
* chain: `frey_modular_13` + `freyLevel26_computational` +
  `ribet_level_lowering_26` + axiom-free `hGeomForbid_typed_true`
* `chain_secure` :
  `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Typed → ribet_secured_by_certs`

`hGeomForbid_typed_true` still depends on no axioms
(`hNotIn hInList`). Old `#check hGeomForbid_typed_is_uninhabitable`
stays live. Not `∀ ℕ`. No `False.elim`.

### v4.7.0 Iter typed no axioms

Certified Cremona models and the PARI 2.17.2 archive
[`lean/BealLevel26Foundations/Certs/Descent_26.json`](lean/BealLevel26Foundations/Certs/Descent_26.json)
(SHA-256 `d9d907f6cf29e9a90731184f082d430d33128f0f857e6a8124a1eef0b8e39260`):

Lean names on that archive:

* `SelmerBound_* = 1`; `rankZero_unconditional` is that equality twice (`1 = 1`).
* `certifiedM3_det_nonzero`: `det M₃ = 2 ≠ 0` over `ZMod 3`.
* `Chabauty0ForcesCusp_computational` is `rankZero_unconditional ∧ det ≠ 0`.
* `FreyLevel26` is `2 * 13 = 26` (`rfl`). Mathlib 4.12 has no Ribet / modularity; this is the displayed level only.
* `X0_26_Q_four` is `rankZero_unconditional ∧ Chabauty0ForcesCusp_computational`.
* v4.4.0-typed-refactor-true-close `d3cf8a7`: `ExistsNoncuspidal_26`

Checks: `lake build` of `BealTheoremFromMazurChain26`,

`RationalPoints_26_FourCusps_26`, plus `verify-scaffold.sh` and
`verify_descent_26.py`, green. No `sorry`, no `False.elim`.

This is a computational boundary. Mathlib 4.12 has no `SelmerGroup`,
`MordellWeil.rank`, or Ribet. Green `lake` / CI is a Lean build, not a DOI.

Folder READMEs under `docs/`, `lean/`, `sagemath/`, and `scripts/` describe
what each directory actually contains and what it does not claim.

## Starting point

The companion Beal v11.0.0 assembly compiles
`Beal.Final.ConditionalBealTheorem` from five explicit theorem arguments. It
is conditionally complete: this repository does not silently change the
status of that theorem.

1. `J0DecompositionSoundness_26 J0_26`;
2. `MwrankCertificateSoundness_26`;
3. `FormalImmersionSoundness_26 J0_26 cotangent`;
4. `FreyCurveExists`, reusing `FreyCurveConstruction_26`; and
5. `LevelLowering_26`, packaging the indexed modularity supplier and
   `LevelLoweringCertificate_26`.

This repository does not claim those premises are already discharged. Its first
release independently checks the displayed mod-3 matrix, the two normalized
eigenform coefficient lines from which that matrix is derived, eight signed
S-units, ten coefficient rows, and the complete `8 × 10` finite bad-prime
audit. The parent repository remains the canonical home for the conditional
theorem and its mathematical interpretation boundaries.

## Staged foundation plan

The staged plan follows four releases.

### v1.x — Unconditional computable foundations

The 101-coefficient level-26 ledger, explicit `M₃`, and complete finite checks
at 2 and 13 are reproducible, kernel-checked computations. The matrix is
derived as `basisChange * coefficientMatrix`, not entered as a differential
table. The audit retains all eight S-unit indices and is proved not to be
singleton, so it is not mislabeled as a genuine 2-Selmer calculation. The
comparison with the genuine cohomological 2-Selmer group remains future
mathematics. The finite symmetric-square cusp-coordinate calculation is
kernel-checked, but it does not construct or identify the actual geometric
Picard/Abel--Jacobi cotangent map.

This is an unconditional statement about the computations themselves. It is
not an unconditional proof of the level-26 endgame.

v1.3.0 adds SageMath 10.7 certificates for the `J₀(26)` decomposition and
the rank-2 `M₃` matrix, promoted in `Beal.Foundations`. That Lean bridge
proves Weierstrass algebra for the two Cremona models and agreement with the
coefficient ledger. v1.4.0 adds `Beal.Foundations.FormalImmersionM3`, which
proves `M₃ = [[1, 1], [0, 2]]` and `det = 2` over `ZMod 3` by `decide` and
matches the ledger. Neither release constructs a Mathlib Jacobian or a
geometric formal immersion.

### Explicit bridge scaffold

`BealLevel26Foundations.Scaffold` gathers the named bridges that remain:
Frey-conductor data, the geometric Riemann--Hurwitz interpretation at
level 26, the Abel--Jacobi/q-expansion cotangent comparison, typed
`LevelLowering_26`, the four-premise Mazur `EndgameScaffold`, and the
Jacobian skeleton (finite `J₀(26)` product, standalone Picard `Prop`,
S-unit versus 2-Selmer audit). These modules introduce no global axiom
and make no unconditional endgame claim; their theorems conclude only
from supplied bridge data or already-checked finite arithmetic.

### Real arithmetic extension

`BealLevel26Foundations.Real` goes beyond the bridge structures where Mathlib
4.12 permits: it defines the Frey Weierstrass model and proves its invariant
and discriminant identities, exhaustively computes the level-26 cusp and
elliptic correction data, verifies the cleared genus equation, and derives
the displayed cotangent matrix from q-expansion coefficients and from the
cotangent linearization of the formal Abel integral on the symmetric-square
cusp chart. v3.0.0 adds typed `LevelLowering_26` data for residual prime,
weight two, and the exact-divide relation `M * p = N`. The local
Tate-conductor classification, Ribet existence, and geometric
Riemann--Hurwitz identification remain named boundaries; none is replaced
by `decide`. v4.0.1--v4.0.2 add the finite `s₁,s₂` Jacobian skeleton and
the eight-index S-unit audit; those files do not construct a Mathlib
Jacobian or identify the audit with genuine 2-Selmer.

The corrected v1.0.1 theorem uses each signed S-unit in the finite-field
equation. It supersedes v1.0.0, whose Lean predicate indexed but did not use
that dimension; the accompanying strong-Hensel replay was already signed.

### v2.0.0 — Frey discriminant foundations

The Frey curve and its `c4`, `c6`, and discriminant identities are constructed
directly. `Conductor_26_Unconditional.lean` proves the odd-prime valuation
input `v_p(c4)=0` and `v_p(Δ)>0` from `p ∤ c4`, `p ∣ Δ`, and `Δ ≠ 0`, without
`frey_conductor_data` or `tate_step2_odd_prime_external`. Mathlib 4.12 has no
Kodaira-type or elliptic-conductor API, so the implication to type `I_n`,
conductor exponent one, and `N = 2^e * rad(ABC)` remains the explicit
Tate-classification boundary.

### v3.0.0 — Ribet level lowering

`LevelLowering_26` is typed certificate data: residual prime, weight two,
source/target levels, and the exact-divide relation. The arithmetic
`v_p(26 p) = 1` from `p ∤ 26` is proved in Mathlib 4.12. Mathlib has no
residual Frey representation, Hecke-algebra transport, or newform existence
theorem, so Ribet's existence statement remains the explicit
`RibetTheoremBoundary26`. This does not replace the parent supplier.

### v4.0.0 — Mazur endgame

Formalize the remaining Mazur chain:

```text
J₀(26)(ℚ) rank 0
  + formal immersion at 2
  ⇒ X₀(26)(ℚ) = four cusps
  ⇒ no level-26 Frey point
  ⇒ BealTheorem
```

v4.0.0-mazur packages that chain as `EndgameScaffold`. The four premises
are typed structures. `BealTheoremFromMazurChain26` concludes `BealTheorem`
only from those structures plus v2 Frey Weierstrass and v3
`LevelLowering_26`. Mathlib 4.12 has no Jacobian, Mordell--Weil, or
formal-immersion API, so rank, actual immersion, `X₀(26)(ℚ) = four cusps`,
and `R = T` remain explicit boundaries. A green scaffold build is not an
unconditional `BealTheorem`.

v4.0.1-jacobian-skeleton adds the finite `s₁ = q₁ + q₂`,
`s₂ = -q₁ q₂` model and the certified `26a × 26b` distinction
`a₂ = -1` versus `1`, and moves `PicardAbelJacobiIdentification_26`
to a standalone Jacobian file.

v4.0.2-selmer audits the eight S-unit indices against genuine
cohomological 2-Selmer. The finite audit retains all eight and is not
a singleton, so it is not mislabeled as a genuine 2-Selmer
calculation. `MwrankCertificateSoundness_26` here is that finite
package for `26a` and `26b`, not a Mordell--Weil theorem.

v4.0.3-formal-immersion inhabits `FormalImmersionAtTwo26` from
q-expansion cotangent injectivity: `M₃ = [[1, 1], [0, 2]]` has
`det = 2 ≠ 0`, so the cotangent map is injective over `ZMod 3`. That
can replace the formal-immersion *input* premise. It is not a
scheme-theoretic immersion.

v4.0.4-x026-rational-points inhabits `X0_26_RationalPoints26` from
the displayed four cusps `[1, 2, 13, 26]` together with that
already-decided q-expansion package. `ofRankZeroAndImmersion` returns
the finite Prop and does not read geometric rank. It is not a Mathlib
`X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem.

v4.0.5-nofrey-point inhabited `NoFreyPoint26` from the displayed
lowering target `26` together with the v4.0.1 (`235a0bc`) → v4.0.2
(`c2f829d` / [10.5281/zenodo.22313148](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22313148))
→ v4.0.3 (`75c533d` / [10.5281/zenodo.22313241](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22313241))
→ v4.0.4 (`4619a5d` / [10.5281/zenodo.22313318](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22313318))
q-expansion chain. That made `hGeomForbid` the uninhabitable
`True → True → False`.

v4.0.6-rank-zero-fixed (this tag) splits that file: Ribet
existence stays in `RibetLoweringActual_26` as
`ExistsFreyWitness` (`loweredLevel = 26`);
`NoFreyPointActual_26` proves `¬ ExistsNoncuspidal` from the
four displayed cusps. `J0_26_Q_RankZeroActual_26` inhabits rank
zero as the product of two Sage-certified rank-zero factors,
without identifying eight S-units with genuine `Sel₂`.
`hGeomForbid` is now `fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal`.
`BealTheoremFromMazurChain26` still names
`hIdentify : ExistsFreyWitness → ExistsNoncuspidal`. v4.0.7-hIdentify
proves that *old* typed implication uninhabitable
(`hIdentify_typed_is_uninhabitable`): a displayed target `26` is a
listed cusp. v4.0.7-hIdentify-j retypes `ExistsNoncuspidal` as an
elliptic `j`, so typed `hIdentify` is the constructor packing
`HIdentify26.of_qExpansion`. Four cusp labels stay as cusps.
`hGeomForbid` (`fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal`) remains the
named geometric gate: that implication would put `False` in the
kernel if inhabited together with the new `hIdentify`.
v4.0.8-geom-forbid records that fact as
`hGeomForbid_typed_is_uninhabitable`. v4.0.9-fourCusps-forall
retypes four cusps as `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints` over
cusp-labeled points. That forall does not range over
`ellipticJ`, so typed `hGeomForbid` stays uninhabitable.
v4.0.10-chabauty0-no-doi adds `Mazur/Chabauty0Actual_26` as that
finite package; it coexists with `ExistsNoncuspidal` and is not
Chabauty--Coleman. v4.0.11-residue-disks-no-doi adds the `M₃`
residue-disk *input* and finite sieve conjunction; those are not
a scheme-theoretic `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem. v4.0.12-scheme-stub-no-doi
adds Jacobian-as-scheme and Abel--Jacobi named boundaries; those
are not a Mathlib Jacobian. v4.0.13-formal-immersion-proof-no-doi
names `det ≠ 0` as `formalImmersion_at_2_surjective_from_M3` and
aliases it as `diskEqualityFromImmersion`; that is not
surjectivity of a map of completed local rings.
v4.0.14-coleman-integral-no-doi names the rank-zero product as
`ColemanVanishesOnRankZero` and conjoins it with `det ≠ 0` as
`Chabauty0ForcesCusp`; that is not a Coleman integral and not a
Chabauty--Coleman theorem. v4.0.15-lmfdb-certs-no-doi records
archived LMFDB display fields; that is not unconditional rank
zero. v4.1.0-descent-start records certified Weierstrass
models. v4.1.1-descent-compute archives PARI `ellrank` /
`ell2cover` with displayed `|Sel₂| = 1`; Lean `SelmerBound_*`
are `1 = 1`, not a Selmer group and not unconditional
Mordell--Weil. v4.1.2-beal-13-endgame records
`rankZero_unconditional` from those equalities and inhabits
an `Option` `hGeomForbid` as that plus `det M₃ ≠ 0`. That is
a computational boundary, not typed
`fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal` and not a Lean
Mordell--Weil theorem. v4.1.3-beal-13-theorem inhabits a
computational `hGeomForbid` structure and names
`BealTheorem_Exponent13` for the `2 × 13` package; that is
not the Beal conjecture. Full `theorem BealTheorem` stays
guarded behind the four-cusp audit. v4.2.0-full-chain names `FreyLevel26` (`2 * 13 = 26`),
`X0_26_Q_four`, and `BealTheorem_Exponent13_Full_package`
as that computational conjunction; that is not
`∀ A B C, ¬ A^13+B^13=C^13`. v4.2.1-chabauty-closes-typed
names `hGeomForbid_typed_closed` as the Chabauty package plus
the cusp-point forall; typed `fourCusps → ¬ ExistsNoncuspidal`
stays uninhabitable. There is no unconditional
`BealTheorem`.

```

Each of those directories has a `README.md` stating current contents and
the interpretation boundary. The initial Lean entrypoint intentionally
contains no `sorry`, `admit`, or domain axiom. New mathematical assumptions
belong in named theorem arguments until the corresponding release removes
them constructively.

## Verification

The workflow runs on pushes and pull requests:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build BealLevel26Foundations
lake build BealLevel26FoundationsScaffold
lake build BealLevel26FoundationsReal
bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh
python3 scripts/verify_descent_26.py
```

The corrected v1.0.1-computable release uses Lean 4.12.0 to match the parent Beal project. The
workflow caches the pinned toolchain and Mathlib artifacts; it does not copy
the parent repository's `.lake` directory or silently import its theorem
boundaries.

A containerized replay of the same three Lake targets is in `DOCKERFILE`.
It installs Elan with no default toolchain, then follows `lean-toolchain`
(`leanprover/lean4:v4.12.0`) and Mathlib `v4.12.0`. Build with:

```sh
docker build -f DOCKERFILE -t beal-level-26-foundations .
docker run --rm beal-level-26-foundations
```

## Relationship to `beal-conjecture`

The repositories are companion works with different purposes:

- `beal-conjecture` keeps the conditionally complete theorem assembly and its
  exact five-premise audit in the archived v11.0.0 companion release
  ([DOI 10.5281/zenodo.22281075](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22281075));
- this repository independently checks the finite matrix and ledger evidence,
  then develops the missing cohomological and geometric comparisons in staged
  releases;
- migration back to the parent project is a later, explicit decision after a
  foundation is independently checked.

This separation prevents an unfinished unconditionalization effort from
changing the interpretation of the already-released conditional theorem.
Foundations v1 is unconditional computable foundations, archived separately
as a Zenodo companion. It does not claim that `decide` proves a genuine Selmer
singleton, and it does not claim an unconditional proof of the endgame.
