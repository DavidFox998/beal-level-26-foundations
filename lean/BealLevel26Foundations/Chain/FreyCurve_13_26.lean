# v4.2.0 Frey / exponent-13 level-lowering *names*

Blueprint: if `A^13 + B^13 = C^13` with coprime positive integers,
the Frey curve `y² = x(x − A^13)(x + B^13)` has conductor dividing
`2 · 13 · rad(ABC)`, and Ribet lowering (residual prime 13) would
target level `26 = 2 · 13`.  That is the classical Darmon / Ribet
step for exponent 13.

Mathlib 4.12 has no modularity theorem, no residual Galois
representation, and no Ribet existence theorem.  This file does
not construct a Frey curve, does not compute a conductor, and does
not prove level lowering.

`FreyConductorDivides26` and `FreyToX0_26` are the displayed
arithmetic `26 = 2 × 13`.  They are not `True`/`trivial`
placeholders and not a Lean Ribet theorem.
