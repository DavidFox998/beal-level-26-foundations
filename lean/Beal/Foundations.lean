# Beal Foundations v1.4.0 certificate bridge, plus v3 typed LevelLowering

Certificate bridge for the SageMath J₀(26) decomposition and finite M₃ data.
`FormalImmersionM3` checks `M₃ = [[1, 1], [0, 2]]` and `det = 2` over
`ZMod 3` against the ledger. `LevelLowering_26` is typed certificate data
for representation, level, and the exact-divide relation; it is not a
Ribet theorem. The Mazur endgame scaffold concludes `BealTheorem` only
from four named structures plus v2 Frey and v3 lowering. The v4.0.2
S-unit audit retains all eight indices and is not genuine 2-Selmer.
v4.0.3 inhabits `FormalImmersionAtTwo26` from q-expansion cotangent
injectivity; that is not a scheme-theoretic immersion. v4.0.4 inhabits
`X0_26_RationalPoints26` from the displayed four-cusp package; that is
not a Mathlib `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem. v4.0.5 recorded displayed
Ribet existence. v4.0.6 splits that existence
(`ExistsFreyWitness`) from the four-cusp list and inhabits
`J0_26_Q_RankZero26` as the product of two Sage-certified
rank-zero factors. That does not identify eight S-units with
genuine 2-Selmer. v4.0.7-hIdentify-j packs a Frey `j`-ratio as
an elliptic displayed point; four cusp labels stay as cusps.
v4.0.8 records that typed `hGeomForbid` is uninhabitable.
v4.0.9 retypes four cusps as `fourCuspsForallCuspPoints` over
cusp-labeled points; a forall over all displayed kinds is
false. Typed `hGeomForbid` stays uninhabitable.
v4.0.10 adds the Chabauty-0 finite package; it is not
Chabauty--Coleman and does not inhabit typed `hGeomForbid`.
v4.0.11 adds residue-disk / sieve *input* packages; those are
not a scheme-theoretic `X₀(26)(ℚ)` theorem.
v4.0.12 adds Jacobian-as-scheme and Abel--Jacobi named
boundaries; those are not a Mathlib Jacobian and are not
inhabited.
v4.0.13 names `formalImmersion_at_2_surjective_from_M3` as
`det ≠ 0` and aliases it as `diskEqualityFromImmersion`; that is
not surjectivity of a map of completed local rings.
v4.0.14 names `ColemanVanishesOnRankZero` as the product
rank-zero package and `Chabauty0ForcesCusp` as that package
plus `det ≠ 0`; that is not a Coleman integral and not a
Chabauty--Coleman theorem.
v4.0.15 records LMFDB display fields for `26a1` and `26b1`; that
is extra computational evidence, not unconditional rank zero.
v4.1.0 records certified Weierstrass models and displayed
Selmer-bound Nats `3` and `7`; those names are `3 = 3` / `7 = 7`,
not a Selmer group and not unconditional Mordell--Weil.
No domain axiom is introduced. Geometric Jacobian, genuine
cohomological Selmer, Picard, Tate, scheme-theoretic Ribet
existence, a Mathlib `X₀(26)` point, and an unconditional
`BealTheorem` remain named later milestones.
