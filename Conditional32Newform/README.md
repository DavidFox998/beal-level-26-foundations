# Conditional level-32 newform bridge

`Bridge.lean` is the integration point for the proved Frey numerics and three
explicit mathematical assumptions.  It proves the discriminant identity

`Δ = 16 A⁸ B⁸ (A⁴+B⁴)²`,

the local valuation identity `v₂₉(Δ) = 26 v₂₉(B+3)`, the divisibility
`13 ∣ v₂₉(Δ)`, and the level arithmetic `928 / 29 = 32` and
`32 * 29 = 928`.  The theorem
`has_newform_at_level_32_of_assumptions` then takes exactly the named Mazur,
Tate, and Ribet assumptions needed by this conditional interface.

## Dependencies and interaction

- `MazurCurve` supplies the vocabulary for the Frey-specific absence of a
  rational `13`-isogeny.  The calculations `|SL₂(𝔽₁₃)| = 2184` and
  `48 < 2184` do not inhabit that boundary.
- `TateCurve` supplies the local Néron/conductor boundary at `29`; its
  valuation numerics alone do not construct Tate uniformization or inertia.
- `RibetCurve` supplies the `928 → 32` lowering boundary; the quotient
  calculation does not construct a residual eigenform.
- `KolyvaginCurve` is deliberately not a dependency of the bridge.
  `L/Ω = 1/3`, `L/Ω = 1/7`, and displayed `Sel₂_card = 1` concern a separate
  analytic and Mordell–Weil route.

## Formal status

`HasNewformAtLevel32` is a proposition-valued evidence record.  It is not a
Mathlib modular-form object and does not claim an unconditional newform.
Removing its assumptions requires Wiles/BCDT modularity, a geometric
mod-`13` Galois representation with absolute irreducibility, Tate/Néron and
cyclotomic-inertia theory, mod-`13` unramifiedness, genuine Ribet lowering,
identification with `32a1`, and complete Kraus bad-reduction elimination.

## Forward closure

`BridgeForward.lean` packages the three assumptions without changing their
formal status. `Conditional32BridgeData` requires the exact Mazur
Borel/Fricke and global-exclusion boundaries, the full Tate
uniformization/Néron/`q^(1/13)`-inertia boundary, and the full residual
`32a1`/Kraus boundary. Because the newer concrete namespaces and the older
conditional bridge use distinct proposition names, it also requires three
explicit typed conversion boundaries; none is silently identified or
inferred from numerics. The projections
`frey_no_rational_13_isogeny_forward`,
`Frey_conductor_29_is_Neron_forward`, and `Ribet_928_to_32_forward` produce
the old bridge's three hypotheses in that order.

`has_newform_at_level_32_of_assumptions_forward` then applies the existing
three-assumption theorem and returns `HasNewformAtLevel32Data`.
`conditional_32_bridge_forward` records both the explicit inputs and the
result. The discriminant, valuation, level arithmetic, group orders,
`a₂₉ = -10`, `L/Ω = 1/3, 1/7`, `Sel₂_card = 1`, and `2^dim = 1` remain a
separate numerical surface and do not construct any of those inputs.
